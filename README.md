# Police Union Contracts

### Purpose
This repo holds text files of police union contracts, scraped from www.checkthepolice.org and parsed using the OCR library [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

Note for now that these files haven't been cleaned up in any meaningful way - they contain the raw output of the tesseract parser. In the future I'd like to clean these files up to make them more suitable for analysis.

For now though this repo can be used as a searchable database of these contracts. To search the repo, type your query into GitHub's search bar up there in the navbar and click "In this repository". That should link you to every contract that has that search term.

Data is up to date as of 6/1/2020
