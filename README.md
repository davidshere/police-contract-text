# Police Union Contracts, Parsed

### Purpose
This repo holds text files of police union contracts, scraped from www.checkthepolice.org and parsed using the PDF parsing library tesseract.

Note for now that these files haven't been cleaned up in any meaningful way - they contain the raw output of the tesseract parser. In the future I'd like to clean these files up to make them more suitable for analysis.

Data is up to date as of 6/1/2020
