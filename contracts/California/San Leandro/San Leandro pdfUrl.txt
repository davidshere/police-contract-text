SLPMU

In January 2014 and 2015, employees and City will each pay 50% of the increase or
decrease in medical and dental premiums based on Kaiser and the Basic dental plan (ie.,
2014 premiums minus 2013 premiums, divided by 2 ete.).

Employees who wish to waive enrollment in the medical and dental plans and who
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City their enrollment in another medical and dental
plan will receive opt-out payments as follows:

Employee rate: Medical $200 +/or dental $50 = $250/month maximum
Two-party rate: Medical $350 +/or dental $50 = $400/month maximum
Family rate: Medical $500 +/or dental $50 = $550/month maximum

In the event both spouses are employed by the City and eligible to enroll in the City’s
benefits plan, one employee may elect not to enroll in the medical and dental plans and will
receive the single employee opt-out rate of up to two-hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per

month payment, if enrolled under spouse's medical and dental coverage.

An employee may elect to waive the dental plan only and enroll only in the medical plan and
receive fifty dollars ($50.00) per month for their non-election.

Re-enrollment in the medical and/or dental plan shall be allowed only based upon a
qualifying event as defined by the IRS codes or during an open enrollment period.
23

SLPMU.

No change in dental plan carrier, or level of benefits, shall be made unless agreed to by the
Management UNIT.

Medical and Dental (Retiree)

Five Year Health & Welfare Vesting Requirement: Unless otherwise determined by the
City Manager as part of the initial hiring agreement, full-time employees hired on or alter
January 1, 2005 must render five (5) years of continuous service with the City of San
Leandro in order to receive retiree medical and/or dental benefits under this section.

Medical: Under CalPERS rules, the City will directly contribute "the employer minimum
share" towards retiree medical coverage. Additional retiree health contributions will be
made on a reimbursement basis as set forth below. The amounts listed below are inclusive of

the CalPERS Medical Pian “employer minimum share.”

The City shall pay the contributions required by the health plan two-party rate for retired
full-time City employees who were assigned to classifications represented by the San
Leandro Management UNIT and who are currently members of one of the City’s health

plans. The City shall contribute to the health plan two-party rate costs until the employee is
eligible for Medicare coverage. The maximum amount to be contributed by the City shall
not exceed three hundred and sixty dollars ($360.00) per month. In the event the amounts
required by the health plans exceed the maximum City contribution, such excess amounts
shall be paid by the retiree, except as provided herein. Coverage under this section shall

continue until the employee's 65th birthday; except for the PERS Medical Plan “employer

minimum share,” which shall continue for life.

Retired employee dependent eligibility for City health plan contribution is conditional upon
the active enrollment of the retired employee. If a retired employee moves outside the
service area of their medical plan the retiree will be allowed an opportunity within thirty
(30) days of such move to change medical insurance coverage to another CalPERS option. If
a retired employee remarries, the retiree may add the retiree’s spouse to the medical
insurance coverage. The City shall have no obligation to obtain medical insurance for a

retiree living outside the service area of its medical insurance plans. The “employer

minimum share” contribution toward CalPERS retiree insurance will continue, however

Dental: The City shall contribute a maximum of seventy dollars and eighty-seven cents
($70.87) towards monthly dental plan costs for each retired full-time City employee who is
currently a member of the City’s dental plan, or who was a member of the City's dental plan

and retired on or after July 1, 1983. Any increases in dental plan costs during the term of this
Agreement shall be split equally between the City and the retired employee. Coverage shall
continue until age 65.

No change in dental plan carrier, or level of benefits, shall be made unless agreed to by the
Management UNIT.

2.6

Life Insurance (Active)

The City shall maintain in effect employer provided Term Life Insurance with AD&D in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for active full-time employees. The insurance
provider shall be “A-rated”, unless the parties specify otherwise. The City shall make
available for employees, the ability to purchase additional life insurance, at no cost to the
City, subject to the requirements and rules of the insurance carrier. Such premium payments

made by the employee purchasing any voluntary life insurance shall be made on an after tax
basis.

Long Term Disability Insurance (Active)

The City shall maintain in effect an employer paid long-term disability insurance program
with a benefit percentage of forty percent (40%) of base monthly earnings with a maximum
gross monthly benefit of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for all full-time employees. The
plan shall provide a six month elimination period, benefits payable to age 65 with two years
"own" occupation and partial disability benefits. The City shall make available for
employees, the ability to purchase additional long term disability insurance, at no cost to the
City, subject to the rules, regulations, enrollment requirements and exclusions set forth by
the insurance carrier.

disability insurance, at no cost to the City, subject to the rules, regulations, enrollment
requirements and exclusions set forth by the insurance carrier. Such premium payments
made by the employee purchasing any voluntary short-term disability insurance shall be
made on an after-tax basis.

Section 3.0 Uniform Allowance

All uniform allowances will be paid by separate check during the month of July. Retroactive
amounts due for 2013 ($450) will be paid by separate check in October 2013.

Section 4.0 Leaves

41

SLPMU

Vacation Leave: Vacation leave for each full-time employee shall be accrued and credited
for the pay period in which it was earned. An employee holding a full-time position shall be
entitled to a vacation leave which shall accrue at the rate of twelve (12) days for each
calendar year of service performed. If a newly hired employee possesses five (5) years of
experience in the field in which he/she is hired, he/she shall accrue vacation leave at the rate
of fifteen (15) days for each calendar year of service performed.

The City evaluated employees hired before February 1, 2002 who had not yet performed
five (5) full years of City service, to determine if they possessed the required experience
when they were hired. If so, their accrual rate was changed to fifteen (15) days. If not, their
accrual rate was changed from ten (10) days to twelve (12) days effective January 1, 2002.
4.2

SLPMU

In the calendar year in which an employee holding a full-time position completes five (5)
full years of City service, such employee shall be entitled to fifteen and three- quarters (15

¥%) work days of vacation. For each full year of full-time City service completed thereafter,

three-quarters (%) of a work day of vacation shall be added up to a maximum of twenty-five
(25) work days of vacation.

An employee who is in unpaid status for 44 or more hours in a pay period shall not accrue
vacation leave for that pay period.

In the event one or more municipal holidays falls within a vacation leave, such days shall
not be charged as vacation leave and the vacation leave shall be extended accordingly for
those employees eligible for such holidays.

Management employees may accumulate vacation leave up to a maximum of three (3) years
vacation accrual. An additional year may be accumulated with Department Head approval.

Employees shall be allowed to sell up to 120 hours of vacation per year. Time may be sold
twice annually in June and December. For 2013 only, the initial sell back period will be in
August. Vacation sell back will be paid by separate check.

Sick Leave: Sick leave is a paid leave. Sick leave is to be used in cases of actual sickness or
injury of the employee or of a member of his/her immediate family which compels an
employee to be absent from work. To qualify for paid sick leave, an employee must notify
his/her supervisor as soon as possible, but no later than thirty minutes prior to the start of the
work day. Sick leave may also be used for routine dentist and doctor visits as these visits
maintain the health and productivity of the employee.

The immediate family of an employee includes the employee's spouse, registered domestic

partner, children, stepchildren, parents, grandparents and step parents, where there was a
child-rearing relationship, who are permanent household members and whose well-being is

dependent on the employee’s care as defined in the Personnel Rule X, Section 2, Sick Leave.

A full-time employee will accumulate sick leave at a rate of eight (8) hours for each full
calendar month of service. An employee who is in unpaid status for 44 or more hours in a
pay period shall not accrue sick leave for that pay period.

As part of the initial hiring agreement, the City Manager may grant to a new management

employee up to one-half of that employee's sick leave accumulated from the most recent
employer, to a maximum of 160 hours.

The maximum sick leave accrual shall be 2,400 hours (300 days)

Payment for unused sick leave will be granted to full-time regular employees with at least
fifteen (15) years continuous City service at death, retirement or resignation in good
standing based on salary at termination, pursuant to the following schedule. Number of sick
leave days accumulated, multiplied by seven and one-half percent (772%), multiplied by the
number of whole years of service, multiplied by the hourly rate at termination.
4.3

4.4

45

SLPMU

The above formula figure of seven and one-half percent (74%) will be adjusted to ten
percent (10%) for an employee who terminates City service after completing twenty-five
(25) years of uninterrupted City service by way of termination, service retirement or
resignation in good standing with the City.

An employee whose death or permanent disability is a result of an accident which is held to
be compensable by the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board will receive payment for
unused sick leave without regard to continuous City service according to the seven and one-
half percent (744%) formula. An employee who completed twenty-five (25) or more years of

uninterrupted service shall receive payment for unused sick leave in accordance with the ten
percent (10%) formula as described in the above paragraph.

Payouts upon termination are deducted from sick leave service time credit under CalPERS.

Funeral Leave: In the event of death in the immediate family of a full-time management
employee, the employee shall, upon request to the supervisor, be granted such time off with
pay as is necessary to make arrangements for the funeral and attend same, not to exceed a
total of five (5) working days. This provision does not apply if the death and/or funeral
occurs during the employee's paid vacation, or while the employee is on leave of absence,
layoff, sick leave, or any other leave status.

The immediate family of an employee includes wife, husband, child, father, mother, sister,
brother, grandchildren, grandparents, mother-in-law, father-in-law, or step-parent where
there is a child-rearing relationship.

Funeral leave applies only in instances in which the employee attends the funeral or is
required to make funeral arrangements, but is not applicable for other purposes such as
settling the estate of the deceased. It is understood, however, that leave as provided in the
preceding paragraph may be granted to commence prior to the death of a member of the

employee's immediate family or where death appears imminent.

Family Medical Leave Act/California Family Rights Act (FMLA/CFRA). Employees
may be eligible for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the
California Family Rights Act (CFRA). The administration of any FMLA or CFRA leave
provided for under this provision shall be in accordance with the provisions of the FMLA
and the CFRA. Leave provided under this provision may run concurrently with other leaves
provided under this agreement, as designated by the Human Resources Department.
Additional information regarding available leave benefits is set forth in City Administrative
Procedure 1600, Family and Medical Leave Request Process and applicable State and/or
Federal law.

Pregnancy Disability. Employees may be eligible for leave under the California Pregnancy
Disability Leave Law (PDLL). The administration of any leave given under the PDLL shall
be in accordance with the provisions of the PDLL. Leave provided under this provision may
run concurrently with other leaves provided under this agreement. Additional information
regarding available leave benefits is set forth in City Administrative Procedure 1630.
Section 5.0 Holidays

Full-time regular employees shall be entitled to the following holidays: New Year's Day; third

entitled to a day off in lieu thereof within the calendar year. The day selected shall be subject to
approval of the Police Chief. When such day herein listed fails on a Sunday, such day off in lieu
thereof shall be the Monday following such Sunday, except as hereinafter provided.

Each employee represented by the Unit shall also be entitled to one floating holiday , which shall be
scheduled at time mutually convenient to the employee and the Police Chief. The floating holiday
must be taken during each calendar year and may not be carried over to another calendar year or
converted to pay.

To the extent that operating conditions allow, employees are to be given the day off on the date of
the holiday. Where operating conditions require established organized shifts to be regularly staffed
without regard to holidays, the Police Chief shall designate by list the positions required to be
staffed. The list of positions so designated shal! be subject io approval of the City Manager, and
shall be filed with the Human Resources Director and the Finance Director. If an employee holding
a position on such a list works an established organized shift on a holiday, the employee can receive
segular pay plus one and one-half times the regular hourly rate of pay times the hours worked on the
holiday. As an alternate, the employee may receive regular pay for the holiday plus compensatory
time off at the one and one-half time rate. Such time off shall be considered compensatory time,
subject to the San Leandro Police Department sign-up procedure. When a day herein listed as a
holiday falls on a regular day off for an employee holding a position on such list, such employee
shall be entitled to a day off in lieu thereof during the succeeding calendar year, or current calendar
year with departmental approval according to the same sign-up procedure. The above provisions
shall be effective as to any employee transferred to a position designated as required to be staffed
without regard to holidays on the approved list, and shall cease to be effective as to an employee
transferred from such a position, as of the date of the transfer.

Any remaining R time not utilized during any calendar year will be paid out on the first paycheck of
the following year on an hour-for-hour basis. When employment of a person occupying a position
on the approved list is terminated, the employee shall receive compensation for holidays accrued in
the previous calendar year, but not yet taken, and for only those holidays, which have already
occurred in the current calendar year. In no event shall an employee accrue more than thirteen (13)
holidays per calendar year.

An employee assigned to the patrol, or traffic division and who is subject to a rotational schedule
may receive for any eight (8) hours holiday worked, one and one-half times the straight-time rate of
pay.

SLPMU 8
Section 6.0 Management Incentive Pay

Full-time Unit employees shall receive management incentive pay at the rate of 80 hours per
calendar year; such amount shall be paid equally at each pay period. Such pay is given in
recognition of the unique nature of their position (e.g. projects, resolution of difficult issues).

Section 7.0 Bilingual Pay

Police Officers utilizing bilingual skills shall be paid an additional thirty dollars ($30.00) per day
while performing that duty. Bilingual skills shall be those certified in advance of their performance
by the Chief of Police as necessary to the operation of the Department and confirmed by an
appropriate testing process prior to compensation for such services. Recertification of need and
ability shall occur every three years.

Section 8.0 Deferred Compensation

The City shall maintain in effect the deferred compensation program as described in the San
Leandro Administrative Code for the term of this Agreement.

Section 9.0 Employee Wellness

For the period of this Memorandum of Understanding, the concept of employee wellness will
continue to be addressed by the City through, but not limited to, executive medical examinations,
workshops around health and wellness. The City agrees to continue to provide to employees an
Employee Assistance Program as described in the City of San Leandro Personnel Manual,
Administrative Procedure 1570. It is agreed that such program shall not be an automatic substitution
for appropriate disciplinary action when such action is appropriate.

Section 10.0 Retirement— Two-tier System

The City shall continue to contract with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System

(CalPERS) to provide retirement benefit programs for the term of this Memorandum of
Understanding.

10.1 Tier One: For employees hired by the City into the SLPMU prior to January 1, 2013, or for
“classic” members of CalPERS hired after January 1, 2013, the City’s contract with CalPERS

provides the 3% @ age 50 retirement formula, fourth level 1959 Survivors Benefit and the
Military Service credit, with 12 months final compensation.

Effective July 1, 2013, tier one employees shall commence paying 3% of the employee
contribution and the City shall contribute 6%. Effective July 1, 2014, employees shall
commence paying 6% of the employee contribution and the City shall contribute 3%.
Effective June 1, 2015, employees shall commence paying 9% of the employee contribution
and the City shall contribute 0%. Pursuant to IRS Code Section 414 (h) (2), these payments
shall be made on a pre-tax basis.

SLPMU 9
10.2 Tier Two: For employees hired on or after January 1, 2013 and classified as “new” members
of CalPERS as defined by Public Employees Pension Reform Act (PEPRA), the City shall
maintain a contract with CalPERS for the provision of a 2.7% @ 57 (highest 36 months)
retirement benefit formula. Also pursuant to PEPRA, these employees are responsible for
paying one-half of the normal cost of this retirement plan.

Section 11.0 Compensation

Salary for each classification varies from step 1 to step 5 as shown in Appendix A of this
agreement. New hires and promotions may-be placed at the step closest to-a minimum five percent

(5%) base salary increase, or any step, subject to the City Manager's final approval. For 2013 only,
any Police Lieutenant will be paid, prospectively, one step above any new promotion. Employees

may be advanced from their current step to the next higher step after each year of satisfactory
performance.

The appendix reflects wage adjustments as follows:

A three (3%) percent across the salary schedule adjustment effective July 1, 2013.
A four (4%) percent across the salary schedule adjustment effective July 1, 2014.
A five (5%) percent across the salary schedule adjustment effective June 1, 2015.

Section 12.0 Employee Defense and Indemnity

In the event that all or part of a claim or judgment is for punitive or exemplary damages in any
action otherwise governed by Section 825 of the Government Code and upon request of the
employee against whom such claim or judgment is rendered, the City agrees to consider whether the
findings set forth in Section 825(b) (1) through (3) may be made. This provision in no way obligates
the City to pay punitive or exemplary damages unless it in fact makes those findings.

Section 13.0 Layoff

The appointing authority may lay off an employee in the competitive service because of material
change in duties or UNIT or shortage of work or funds. If, by reason of expiration of a leave of
absence, reduction in personnel, demotion to the class, or other cause, there are more employees in
any class in the full-time competitive service than there are available positions in that class, the
employee last employed in the class shall be laid off; if such employee obtained such position by
promotion, he/she shall be demoted to the lower class from which he/she was promoted rather than
be laid off. Layoff or demotion shali be based upon the amount of seniority an employee has in the
classification he/she is occupying (i.c., the employee with the least amount of seniority in the class
shall be the first to be laid off or demoted, if job was obtained by promotion).

Forty (40) days before the effective date of a layoff, the appointing authority and/or designee shall
notify Human Resources of the intended action with reasons therefore, and a statement certifying
whether or not the services of the employee have been satisfactory. A copy of such notice shall be
given to the employee affected at that time. If certified as having given satisfactory service, the
name of the employee laid off shall be placed on the appropriate re-employment list.

Employees shall be given thirty (30) days written notice before the effective date of layoff.

SLPMU 10
All laid-off employees shall be placed on a re-employment list for the class from which they were
laid off or demoted (i.e., the last person in the affected class to be laid off shall be the first re-hired
when openings occur in that class or any other of the same pay for which the employee is qualified).
If the employee on the re-employment list refuses the initial offer of re-employment, the employee's
name shall be placed at the end of the re-employment list. If the same employee refuses proffered
re-employment the second time, the employee shall be removed from the list and shall no longer be
eligible for re-employment as a laid off employee.

Employees on the re-employment list shall be offered positions for which they qualify before new
employees are hired.

Re-employment lists shall remain in effect for a period of one year. All employees on the re-
employment list shall be mailed notices of vacancies in the City for a period of one year after their
layoff.

Section 14.0 Work Hours

When management employees work extraordinary hours; due to large numbers of night meetings,
emergencies, major projects, etc., they may, subject to the approval of the Department Head, or in
the case of a department head, the City Manager, be authorized additional time off. Such time will
be granted only for extraordinary hours; both in excess of the regular work schedule and that time
compensated for by administrative leave; and not exceed forty (40) hours per year.

Managers in 24/7 operations whose regular work shift falls on a City holiday shall receive an
equivalent number of hours off duty, to be scheduled subject to Department Head approval and used
within one month of the holiday. Such time will not be banked, incremented, or paid in lieu of time
off.

In no event shall this time be construed to constitute overtime compensation nor shall it be applied
on an hour for hour basis. This time has no cash value and is not bankable.

Section 15.0 FEMA Reimbursed Overtime

In cases where there has been a declared emergency and the City receives cash reimbursement from
FEMA, the City will reimburse represented employees for extraordinary overtime at an hour for
hour basis.

Section 16.0 Flexible Work Schedules

When operationally appropriate and determined to be in the best interest of the City, departments
may establish flexible work schedules. Establishment of such schedules shall be in the sole
