8.4 Compensation for Overtime

A. The preferable method by which overtime shall be compensated is by monetary
payment, at one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay.

B. Should the Police Chief determine that the best interests of the City will be served
thereby, he or his designee may permit an employee to be compensated for overtime
work by earning paid compensatory time off at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2)
times the employee's regular rate of pay. The employee will be credited with time
off at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) hours of time for each hour of overtime
worked. This time, hereinafter identified as “comp time” will be accrued in a comp
time bank for each employee. The hours in this bank shall reflect the converted time
value of each hour worked.

420 160 hours of comp time. Effective July 1, 2010, employees are limited

affected employee who has accrued comp time credits, may elect to convert up
to ferty{40) twenty (20) hours of such accrued time each calendar year
quarter to the cash equivalent thereof, to a maximum of eighty (80) hours per
calendar year.

   
 

       

3. For the period July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, employees paid out of the
General Fund of the City agree that compensation to them for overtime
earned by them shall be in the form of compensatory time off (comp time)
unless and until they have accumulated a maximum of 200 hours of comp
time. Any accumulation of compensatory time in excess of 200 hours shall
be paid in cash.

4. For the period of July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, employees covered by
this Agreement agree to defer the cash out of any comp time. The cash
out option, as modified below, shall be reinstated effective July 1, 2011.
The designated periods for cash out shall be September 15 and ending
September 30; December 15 and ending December 31; March 15 and
ending March 31; and June 15 and ending June 30.

5. The deferral of the cash out option shall not affect an employee's ability
to be compensated for all accumulated comp time upon separation from
employment with the City.

Cc. Use of Comp Time.

1. When an employee submits a request for time off using accrued
compensatory time, and that employee has found a qualified replacement,
the time off request will be granted. “Qualified A qualified
replacement means that the replacement officer or employee is able to
fulfill the requirements of the position to which the requesting officer is
assigned.

2. When an employee submits a request to take time off using accrued
compensatory time and the officer deployment is above minimum staffing
for that the requested day, then the request will be granted without
further conditions. However, if the number of officers scheduled to
work on the day(s) of the request is at or below minimum staffing as
defined by the department, the compensatory time off request will be
granted only if a qualified replacement has volunteered and committed to
work the assignment left open by the request for time off. The
volunteer may exchange days off with the requesting employee within the

 

POA CONTRACT EXTENSION 2010-13 Page 3
14-day or 7-day work period, whichever applies, or may elect to receive
overtime compensation.

a. For the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, requests
under this section will be granted only if the volunteer agrees to
exchange days off within the 14 day or 7 day work period, and
agrees that he or she will not be subject to payment for
overtime as a result of the exchange.

3. Requests for use of compensatory time off during holidays as defined by
the current MOU, must be submitted in time to be considered during
the monthly scheduling meeting held by bureau and division commanders
for the upcoming month. These requests will be considered by seniority
and will be granted only if officer deployment is above minimum staffing.

4. Although it is always preferable for the officer to find a qualified
replacement when requesting the use of compensatory time off, if
provided sufficient notice of a request for time off, the department will
work with employees to find a qualified replacement. Sufficient notice
and reasonable period will be defined as follows:

a. Seventy-two (72) hours notice for one (1) day or less of time off
requested.

b. Five (5) calendar days notice for more than one (1) workday up to one
(1) workweek.

c. Fourteen (14) calendar days notice for more than one (1) week
compensatory time off request.

5. If an employee has provided sufficient notice of a compensatory time off
request, the department will work with the employee to find a qualified
replacement in the following manner:

a. The watch commander will maintain a calendar of time off that has been
requested in accordance with the guidelines listed above, Qualified
employees will be allowed to volunteer to work these shifts. In the
future, the department may develop, at its own discretion, an
automated schedule that will contain this information.

b. If an employee volunteers and signs up to work for another employee
who has requested compensatory time off, that volunteering employee
will be held responsible for working that full shift without further
reminder. Employees who do not show up to work, or retract their
offer to replace another officer, may be subject to disciplinary action

— —
POA CONTRACT EXTENSION 2010-13 Page 4
and may not be permitted to volunteer to work in this manner in the

future.

6. The watch commander shall send out an e-mail message to all officers
requesting a volunteer to cover the shift by switching days off or working on
overtime.

7. When a compensatory time off request is made in a manner that does not

comply with this policy, and granting that request would unduly disrupt the
operations of the department, the department may deny that request.
