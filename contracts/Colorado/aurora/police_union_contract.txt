PREAMBLE

This Agreement between the City of Aurora, herein referred to as the "City", and
the Aurora Police Association, herein referred to as the "Association", is designed to promote the
improvement of labor relations between the City of Aurora and the commissioned officers of the
Police Department, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by assuring at all times the
orderly and uninterrupted operations and services of City government. It is understood that this
Agreement was negotiated in good faith and shall not be violated or abridged in any way by
either party.

ARTICLE 1. COPIES OF AGREEMENT

The City shall furnish to each member of the Association copies of this
Agreement; additionally, the City shall place in each Administrative Order Manual in all
divisions of the Police Department a copy of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 2. NON-DISCRIMINATION, ASSOCIATION ACTIVITY AND FAIR
SHARE

Section 1: The provisions of this Agreement in accordance with applicable
federal and state laws shall be applied equally to all employees without discrimination as to sex,
marital status, race, color, creed, national origin, age, religion, handicaps or political affiliation,
governed only by the limitation of the law regarding bona fide occupational qualifications.

Section 2: No department supervisor or representative of the City shall
discriminate against any employee because he has formed, joined or chosen to be represented by
the Association or because he has given testimony or taken part in any grievance procedure or
other hearings, negotiations or conferences as part of the Association recognized under the terms
of this Agreement.

Section 3: | When the Police Chief or his/her designee has granted prior
approval, Association officials or representatives shall be allowed time away from their assigned
duty station in order to conduct Association business. Nothing herein shall limit the discretion of
the Police Chief or his/her designee in approving such time off.

Section 4: As a condition of employment, within thirty (30) days of the
effective day of this Agreement, or within thirty (30) days of being hired into the bargaining unit,
and continuing thereafter all Police Officers shall either be an active member of the Association
or shall pay to the Association the Officer's fair share of the cost of negotiating and
administering this Agreement, including all costs germane to collective bargaining.

Section 5: The City agrees to deduct the Association membership or initiation
fees, dues, general or special assessments and fair share payments from the monthly gross pay of
each officer who individually requests in writing that such deduction be made. The Association
shall designate the amount of the deduction and the aggregate amount of such deduction shall be
remitted, together with an itemized statement, to the Association no later than the fifteenth day of
the month in which such deductions are made. The written authorization for deduction
hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until revoked in writing by the officer.

Section 6: _ The Association agrees that it will indemnify and save the City
harmless from all suits, actions and claims against the City or persons acting on behalf of the
City whether for damages, compensation, or any other combination thereof arising out of the
City's compliance with the terms of Section 4 herein unless such damages are caused by the
City's mistake. The Association shall reimburse the City for any and all reasonable costs and
attorney's fees arising out of the defense of any such action against the City. The City agrees to
cooperate with the Association and its counsel concerning any such litigation.

ARTICLE 3. LEAVE SHARING PROGRAM

All members of the bargaining unit shall be allowed to participate in the leave
sharing program implemented by the City and pursuant to the rules and regulations of that
program, and the City agrees that the program as adopted in 1992 shall not change for members
of the bargaining unit during the term of this Agreement unless the Association agrees to such
changes. A Police Officer recommended by the Association shall be appointed by the Chief on
the leave sharing committee for decisions that affect members of the bargaining unit.

provision. The City shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the expense of repair and
replacement for all footwear provided by the City. When footwear needs to be resoled, the
Police Officer shall select any sole consistent with the rules and regulations of the Aurora Police
Department.

Section 3: — The City shall provide a clothing allowance of $30.00 per month
for non-uniform Police Officers.

purchasing a soft body armor vest provided that this allowance shall be made available to each
Police officer only one time every four years. If the vest is rendered unserviceable due to Police
related activity, the City shall pay the full cost for replacement of the vest. If the City receives
federal funds for the purchase of vests, the money will be used to reimburse the officer up to the
full cost of the vest. The Police Officer may purchase the vest from the City’s supplier in the
same manner as any other equipment. If the vest costs more than the allowance, the Police
Officer shall pay the difference. Also, the Police Officer may purchase the vest at any other
supplier and submit the receipt for reimbursement up to the amount of the allowance.

which has been previously scheduled and approved, he/she shall be compensated at his/her
hourly rate for each and every hour above the maximum accrual.

ARTICLE 6. PERSONAL LEAVE

not be accrued from year to year. Officers who do not utilize their personal leave within a
calendar year will be compensated for up to a maximum of ten (10) hours of unused personal
leave at the straight time rate of pay which applied to them at the end of the calendar year in
which the personal leave time was earned. Any unused personal leave in excess of ten (10)
hours shall be lost.

All commissioned police officers may apply for a leave of absence of up to one
(1) year for purposes of continuing their education or to deal with hardships. Requests for leave
without pay must be approved by the Chief of Police and the City Manager. However, leave
without pay which is given pursuant to the City Charter regarding criminal allegations against
police officers shall not be subject to above procedures and limits, but rather shall be subject to
the language contained in the Charter.

All annual leave must be exhausted before a leave without pay may be granted,
except maternity leave or when leave without pay is used in disciplinary action, or when the
Police Chief approves leave without pay for an employee's professional activities. Any leave
taken pursuant to FMLA shall not be considered leave of absence under this Article. During a
leave without pay of more than one (1) work shift, an employee does not accrue vacation, sick
leave, credited service for longevity, retirement, or step increase. Failure of a police officer to
return from a leave without pay shall result in termination. A police officer on leave without pay
for more than one (1) calendar month must pay the full cost of insurance benefits.

ARTICLE 8. INJURY LEAVE

Injury leave shall be granted to all Police Officers pursuant to the provisions of
the Personnel Policies and Procedures, in effect on May 26, 2010, especially those provisions
relating to injury leave and worker's compensation, except that: (1) injury leave for Police
Officers may continue up to one thousand one hundred seventy-five (1,175) normally scheduled
work hours, and on a case-by-case basis an injured Police Officer may request and the Police
Chief may continue such leave for up to a total of two thousand eighty hours (2,080 hours) of
injury leave, and (2) the City shall continue to make the appropriate health insurance
contribution on behalf of the Police Officer for a period not to exceed four (4) months after a

provisions of this Article. Injury leave shall not be credited against an Officer’s FMLA leave
entitlement.

ARTICLE 16. SAVINGS CLAUSE

If any provision of this Agreement is subsequently declared by the proper
legislative or judicial authority to be unlawful, unenforceable, or not in accordance with
applicable statutes or ordinances, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect for the duration of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 17. OVERTIME AND COMPENSATORY TIME

Section 1: Overtime shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half times (1 1/2
X) a Police Officer's regular hourly rate. Accordingly, such overtime shall not apply to
Lieutenants or Captains, except as specifically authorized by the Chief of Police. Overtime is
defined as work performed in excess of the hours normally scheduled for any one (1) shift (either
eight (8), ten (10) or twelve (12) hours depending on assignment) and/or work performed in
excess of forty (40) hours in any consecutive seven (7) calendar day period for Police Officers
working on a seven (7) day duty cycle. For Police Officers assigned a duty cycle longer than
seven (7) days, overtime shall include any hours worked over forty (40) per week when the
weekly average of hours worked during the duty cycle is calculated.

Section 2: Base Pay. Computation of the officer's hourly rate shall be
determined by adding the officer's annual base salary, steps, longevity pay and shift differential
pay to which the officer is entitled in a given year and dividing that total annual figure by two
thousand eighty (2080) hours. Necessary adjustments, because of the mode of payment of any of
these items, will be made on an annual basis.

Section 3: | Members of the bargaining unit shall be paid overtime pay when
those members are off duty and are required to appear for court, authorized administrative
hearings, or they are required to come to work to perform police functions. Members will be
paid overtime for the actual time worked except that there will be a two-hour minimum overtime
pay for being called in from an off-duty status. Members shall receive two hour minimum
overtime pay for multiple "show-ups" in the same day as long as the show ups are at different
locations or at least two hours apart from one another at the same location. Members who are
required to appear in court immediately after their normal tour of duty will be paid overtime for
the actual time spent in court. Members who are required to appear in court within two hours
immediately preceding their normal duty time will receive the two-hour minimum overtime
payment.

The two-hour minimum overtime pay shall also apply to subpoenas to testify in
job related civil cases as long as any other monies received from outside sources are turned over
to the Department when submitting for overtime payment. When members are required to
appear for Internal Affairs investigations or other municipal administrative hearings they shall
receive the two-hour minimum overtime payment as long as their testimony is for the City. This
section does not apply to an accused member who appears at an administrative hearing if the
alleged charges are sustained.
Members who receive subpoenas for court while they are on suspension without
pay shall not be entitled to the two-hour minimum or to overtime pay under any circumstances.
All pay shall be at straight time for the actual time spent in court.

Section 4: | Compensatory Time. All overtime worked pursuant to the
collective bargaining agreement between the City of Aurora and the Aurora Police Association
shall be compensated for in either money or time off pursuant to this agreement. All overtime
work must be approved by the member's supervisor prior to the work being performed. Time
worked will be recorded pursuant to the Department's established record keeping procedures.

After working overtime the member will designate whether he wants to be
compensated in money or time off. If the member requests compensation in money, that request
will be honored unless a supervisor, for reasonable cause, denies the request. Any such denial is
subject to review through the chain of command and ultimately through the grievance procedure
of the collective bargaining agreement. If the member requests compensation in compensatory
time off, said request shall be granted, absent extraordinary circumstances, until the member
achieves a bank of one hundred sixty (160) hours (106.67 hours of overtime worked). If a
member has accumulated a bank of one hundred sixty (160) hours or more, then a request for
further accrual of compensatory time off must be approved by a Division Chief or his designee.

The maximum amount of time accumulated in a compensatory time bank for each
member, subject to proper approval, is four hundred and eighty (480) hours of compensatory
time off for overtime worked on or after April 15, 1986.

When a member wants to take compensatory time off which was previously
earned, the following procedures will apply. If the member desires to take off a block of time
less than forty (40) hours, his request to do so must be granted within fourteen (14) days of the
request, except under emergency circumstances. If the member desires to take off a block of
time of forty (40) hours or more, the member must make the request to do so at least thirty (30)
days prior to the beginning of the time off. The request will be granted unless, in the judgment
of the Chief and/or his designee, granting the request at the time in question would unduly
disrupt the operations of the Police Department. Under all circumstances, pre-approved
vacations take precedence over requests to use compensatory time.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection 4, the City may, at its sole
discretion, freely substitute cash, in whole or in part, for compensatory time off for all officers.

Upon termination of employment for any reason, including death, the Police
Officer, his beneficiaries or his estate, shall be paid all compensatory time in the member's bank
at the time of termination.

Section 5: | On-Call/Stand-By. Members of the bargaining unit who are
assigned on-call duty and who are specified on a list designated by the Police Chief shall be paid
three (3) hours of overtime pay for each calendar week of on-call duty. Members may elect to
convert these hours to four and a half (4.5) hours of compensatory time.

Section 6: K-9 Officers. Members of the K-9 unit will be compensated for
the care and maintenance of dogs by being credited with four (4) hours of compensatory time at
straight time rate per calendar week.
ARTICLE 18. WORKING OUT OF RANK

Section 1: After a Police Officer fills a vacancy and performs duties of a
higher rank for one hundred and sixty (160) hours, he/she shall receive pay at the higher rank for
all subsequent hours of work in that rank. The one hundred and sixty (160) hours need only be
accumulated one time for that rank following January 1, 2006.

Section 2: Whenever a Police Officer enters into a voluntary agreement with
the Department to be assigned and performs duties of a higher rank in order to receive training
and/or experience in the higher rank, and said agreement is for a predetermined length of time,
the Police Officer shall not receive the pay of the higher rank until the ninety-first (91st) calendar
day of performance of the duties of that higher rank.

ARTICLE 19: SICK LEAVE

Section 1: Sick leave shall be considered proper for the sole purpose of wage
continuation when a Police Officer:

l. Is incapacitated due to illness or non-job related injury;

2. When the Police Officer or immediate family member requires health
examinations or scheduled medical treatment;

3. To supplement worker's compensation benefits after the expiration of
injury leave;

4. When the Police Officer is required to be in attendance for the necessary
medical care of a member of the Officer's immediate family.

If improper use of sick leave is indicated, supervisors have the authority to request
that medical verification for absence be provided. Leave shall be taken according to the sick
leave procedure in the Personnel Policies and Procedures in effect on April 26, 2014.

Section 2: Each member of the bargaining unit shall accrue one hundred
twenty (120) hours of sick leave for each two thousand eighty (2080) hours of regular work.

Section 3: Sick Leave Conversion. Sick leave hours accumulated in excess
of established minimums may be converted annually on January | at a rate of one (1) hour's pay
for each two (2) hours of sick leave up to the established maximum for Police Officers. A sick
leave balance of seven hundred twenty (720) hours is required before any payment will be made.
No more than two hundred forty (240) hours may be converted on an annual basis so that the
maximum payment in any one year shall be one hundred twenty (120) hours.

Section 4: Payment Upon Separation. Upon separation after five (5) years
of continuous service, Police Officers may receive one (1) hour's pay for every two (2) hours of
accumulated sick leave provided such separation has not been the result of dismissal for cause.
The maximum payment for each Police Officer shall be for four hundred eighty (480) hours of

10
unused sick leave. It is understood that the maximum payment specified in this section, of four
hundred eighty (480) hours, is one-half (1/2) of the maximum sick leave accumulation allowed

This Agreement shall become effective January 1, 2015 and all of its provisions
shall remain effective through December 31, 2015. Additionally, all provisions which do not
have a budget impact shall remain effective from and including January 1, 2015 through and
including December 31, 2016.

The parties to this Agreement mutually desire that all of its provisions shall be
and remain effective from January 1, 2015, through and including December 31, 2016.
However, in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the TABOR Amendment, Article
X, Section 20(4)(b) of the Colorado Constitution and because the parties recognize that there
may be an inability on the part of the City of Aurora to contract at this time for items with a
budget impact until such time as the budget process for the fiscal year 2016 is followed, the
parties hereby agree that the Association shall reopen this Agreement for negotiations of all
items with a fiscal impact (impact on budget) which are to be effective on January 1, 2016
through and including December 31, 2016. This reopener shall be initiated within the time limits

14
specified in Article XV of the Charter of the City of Aurora. In the event the parties are unable
to agree that those items contained in the Agreement which by their own terms are to be effective
on January 1, 2016 shall be placed into effect, then that party which refuses to renew the
Agreement at that time shall be deemed to have bargained in bad faith during negotiations
leading to the 2016 Agreement for any and all purposes.

It is specifically understood and agreed that this conclusion of failure to bargain in
good faith shall be utilized by a fact finder, mediator or arbitrator appointed pursuant to Article
XV of the of the Charter of the City of Aurora, and may be the basis relied upon by the fact
finder pursuant to Article XV to recommend that those provisions contained in this Agreement to
be effective on January 1, 2016 should be placed into effect on January 1, 2016.
