e the proper respect.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed that the term should be uniformly capitalized. In so doing,
the Lodge and the City acknowledge that they intend no substantive change of any kind or
degree in the rights, privileges, obligations or benefits of any sworn Police Officer, regardless of
whether the individual is a member of the Lodge’s bargaining unit or is a probationary Police
Officer, ete. Neither party will assert, in any grievance, arbitration, administrative agency or
court proceeding, that the fact that the term “Officer” is now capitalized when it previously was
not has any bearing on the appropriate interpretation of any provision in the Agreement.

Re: Section 29A.4
Dear Mr. Burns:
This letter sets forth the parties’ agreement with respect to Section 29A.4.

Effective calendar year 2012, the Chicago Police Operations Calendar was revised to
provide that the first day of each Police Period will begin on a Sunday. Prior to and in
anticipation of this revision, the Department and the Lodge reached certain understandings and
agreements regarding furloughs and furlough extensions under the new Calendar and in the
context of different work schedules, as set forth in their letter of agreement dated September 2,
2011, It is the parties’ intent that those understandings and agreements shall continue to apply
during the term of this collective bargaining agreement, and the parties’ decision not to revise the
language appearing in Section 29A.4 regarding furloughs and furlough extensions is not intended
to and shall not be interpreted as an agreement to modify the understandings and agreements
referenced in this paragraph.

If the above accurately reflects our agreement, please so indicate by signing your name
below.

Re: Wellness Benefit
Dear President Angelo:

1 am writing to confirm that the reference in Arbitrator Benn’s February 28, 2005 award
to “$600.00 per year (effective 1/1/06)” for the City’s wellness benefit is to be interpreted as
commitment by the City to fund up to $600.00 of eligible wellness benefits for each officer
enrolled in the City’s PPO plans and each covered member of the officer's family who is also
enrolled in the City’s PPO plans.

The parties agree that, effective January 1, 2015, this $600.00 per year wellness benefit
is eliminated and replaced in accordance with the Preventive Care Benefit provided for in
Paragraph (1)(A) of the parties’ Memorandum of Understanding Re: Health Care Plan. The
parties further agree that, if during the term of this Agreement the Preventive Care Benefit
provided for in Paragraph (1)(A) of the parties’ Memorandum of Understanding Re: Health Care
Plan is reduced or eliminated by an amendment to federal law or by @ court ruling, upon the
request of either party, the parties shall meet promptly and negotiate with respect to substitute
terms intended to provide benefits substantially similar to those available under the Preventive
Care Benefit or, if such result is not possible, the pre-existing $600.00 per year wellness benefit.
In the event the parties are unable to agree upon substitute terms, the dispute shall be submitted
to the impasse resolution procedure set forth in Section 28,3(B).

Your acknowledgement and agreement is appreciated in the space provided below.
Very truly yours,
