Between

CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS

THE POLICE OFFICERS' FEDERATION OF MINNEAPOLIS

THIS AGREEMENT (hereinafter referred to as the Labor Agreement or the Agreement) is entered
into between the City of Minneapolis, a municipal corporation incorporated under the laws of the State
of Minnesota (the City, the Employer, or the Department), and the Police Officers' Federation of
Minneapolis (the Federation).

It is the purpose and intent of this Agreement to achieve and maintain sound, harmonious and mutually
beneficial working and economic relations between the Parties hereto; to provide an orderly and
peaceful means of resolving differences or misunderstandings which may arise under this Agreement;
and to set forth herein the complete and full agreement between the Parties regarding terms and
conditions of employment except as the same may be established by past practices which are determined
to be binding by an arbitrator and not included in this contract.

The parties acknowledge and agree that any authority vested in the Chief of Police under this Agreement
may be delegated by the Chief to his/her designee. Where such a delegation is made to a person, who in
the context of the Agreement is someone to whom the Federation should direct communications, the
Chief will notify the Federation as to the identity of the designee. However, in any event
communications made to the Chief will be deemed to be made to the designee.

The Parties hereto agree as follows:

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
RECOGNITION, RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

 

ARTICLE 1
RECOGNITION

Section 1.01 - Representation
The City recognizes the Federation as the exclusive representative for the unit consisting of employees

serving in the following job titles: Police Officer, Sergeant and Lieutenant.

Section 1.02 - Classification Disputes
Disputes which may occur over the inclusion or exclusion of new or revised or other classifications in

the unit described in Section 1.01 above shall be referred to the State Bureau of Mediation Services for
determination pursuant to the provisions of the Public Employment Labor Relations Act, as amended.

ARTICLE 2
PAYROLL DEDUCTION FOR DUES

Section 2.01 - Dues Deductions

The City shall, upon request of any employee in the unit, deduct such sum as the Federation may specify
as the regular dues of the Federation. The City shall remit monthly such deductions to the appropriate
designated officer of the Federation.

Section 2.02 - Fair Share Fee Deductions

In accordance with Minnesota Statutes §179A.06, Subd. 3, the City agrees that upon notification by the
Federation it shall deduct a fair share fee from all certified employees who are not members of the
Federation. This fee shall be an amount equal to the regular membership dues of the Federation, less the
cost of benefits financed through the dues and available only to members of the Federation, but in no
event shall the fee exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the regular membership dues. The Federation
shall certify to the City, in writing, the current amount of the fair share fee to be deducted as well as the
names of bargaining unit employees required by the Federation to pay the fee.

Section 2.03 - Administration.

(a) The City shall annually select a single payroll period in each month for which all monthly
membership dues and fair share fees shall be deducted. In the event an employee covered
by the provisions of this Article has insufficient pay due to cover the required deduction,
the City shall have no further obligations to effect subsequent deductions for the involved
month.

(b) All certifications from the Federation respecting deductions to be made as well as
notifications by the Federation and/or bargaining unit employees as to changes in
deductions must be received by the City at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of
the date upon which the deduction is scheduled to be made in order for any change to be
effected.

(c) The City shall remit such membership dues and fair share fee deductions made pursuant
to the provisions of this Article to the appropriate designated officer of the Federation
Recognition, Rights and Responsibilities

within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of the deduction along with a list of the
names of the employees from whose wages deductions were made.

(d) Each month, the City shall provide to the Federation a report containing the following
current information with regard to all employees covered by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 1.01: name, home address, phone number, hire date, pay status (active or
inactive) and the name of any employee who separated from service since the prior report
with the reason for the separation. The City shall also provide to the Federation a copy of
or electronic access to all transfer lists generated by the Department showing promotions,
demotions, leaves of absence and changes in work location.

Section 2.04 - Hold Harmless Provision

The Federation will indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless against any and all claims made and
against any suits instituted against the City, its officers or employees, by reason of deductions under this
article.

ARTICLE 3
SENIORITY

Seniority as provided for in this Agreement shall be established from the date on which an employee
first attains Step 1 (or any step higher than the “recruit” step if hired under the Lateral Hiring Process in
Section 13.08) on the Police Officer wage schedule. Time while absent from the Department without
compensation, except while on disability leave or while on non-voluntary active military service, shall
not be counted for seniority. Separate seniority lists to determine seniority within each rank shall be
maintained and shall be computed from the date of promotion to that rank. In the event of promotion to
supervisory positions not within the unit and upon return to the unit, all service so performed shall be
computed for seniority purposes to the rank held upon return to the unit. In the event of a demotion to a
lower rank, the seniority accrued in the higher rank shall be applied to the seniority of the lower rank to
which demoted. In the event of ties, ties shall be broken as follows:
1) Veterans, as defined by Minn. Stat. §197.447, shall be senior to non-veterans having the same
seniority date; and
2) Any ties existing after the consideration of veteran status, shall be broken by the ranking of the
employee’s randomly assigned NeoGov application number or such other random system to
which the parties may mutually agree.

ARTICLE 4
NEW OFFICERS ORIENTATION

The President of the Federation, or his/her designee, shall be granted one (1) hour of regularly scheduled
new Officer orientation class time for the purpose of explaining the rights and obligations of employees
under the Public Employment Labor Relations Act of 1971, as amended.

ARTICLE 5
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS

Page 3 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Recognition, Rights and Responsibilities

The Federation recognizes the right of the City to operate and manage its affairs in all respects in
accordance with applicable law and regulations of appropriate authorities. All rights and authority
which the City has not officially abridged, delegated or modified by this Agreement are retained by the
City.

ARTICLE 6
WORK RULES AND REGULATIONS

It is understood that the City, through its various Departments, has the right to establish reasonable work
tules and regulations. The City agrees to enter into discussion with the Federation on additions to or
changes in the existing rules and regulations prior to their implementation. The City further agrees that
changes shall be effective no sooner than three (3) calendar days after posting.

 

ARTICLE 7
UNION COMMUNICATION

The City shall provide reasonable bulletin board space at precincts, divisions and remote locations for
use by the Federation in posting notices of Federation business and activities. The Federation may
communicate with its members regarding Federation business and activities via reasonable use of the
City’s email system. The Federation shall work with the City to minimize the disruption to the City’s
information technology systems that may be caused by such email communications. The parties agree
that the purpose of providing the Federation with bulletin board space and access to the email system is
to foster effective communication relating to union business and is not to serve as a soap box to air
complaints, offer political commentary or exchange personal messages among co-workers. Therefore,
such union communications shall not contain anything that is political, offensive, obscene or that
otherwise violates the City’s Employee Policy on Electronic Communication.

 

ARTICLE 8
STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS

Section 8.01 - No Strike

The Federation, its officers or agents, or any of the employees covered by this Agreement shall not
cause, instigate, encourage, condone, engage in or cooperate in any strike, the stoppage of work, work
slowdown, the willful absence from one's position, or the abstinence in whole or in part from the full,
faithful and proper performance of the duties of employment, regardless of the reasons for so doing.

Section 8.02 - Violations by Employees
Any employee who violates any provision of this Article may be subject to disciplinary action.

In the event the City notifies the Federation in writing that an employee may be violating this Article,
the Federation shall immediately notify such employee in writing of the City's assertion and the
provisions of this Article.

Section 8.03 - No Lockout
The City will not lock out any employee during the term of this Agreement as a result of a labor dispute
with the Federation.

Recognition, Rights and Responsibilities

ARTICLE 9
LEGAL COUNSEL

Section 9.01 - Legal Counsel
The City shall provide legal counsel to defend any employee against any action or claim for damages,

including punitive damages, subject to limitations set forth in Minnesota Statutes §466.07, based on
allegations relating to any arrest or other act or omission by the employee provided: the employee was
acting in the performance of the duties of his or her position; and was not guilty of malfeasance in
office, willful neglect of duty or bad faith.

The City may undertake its obligation to its employee by assigning the matter to the City Attorney or by
employing outside counsel at its discretion. However, where there is a conflict of interest between the
City and its employee, the City Attorney may represent or assign outside counsel based upon the
provisions of this Article. The decision on whether a conflict exists shall be decided in the first instance
by the City Attorney. The City shall pay the costs and expenses associated with such separate and
independent counsel in instances where the limitations set forth in Minnesota Statutes $466.07 do not
apply.

Where the City determines that its position is in conflict with that of its employee, the City shall notify
the employee of the conflict and advise the employee that he or she is entitled to select independent
counsel pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article.

Where the employee believes that his or her position in the litigation is in conflict with that of the City,
the employee may request that he or she be represented by independent counsel. The employee shall
make such request in writing and such request shall specify the facts upon which the employee relies in
asserting the conflict. The City shall have five (5) business days from the date it receives such request to
grant or deny the request and notify the employee in writing of its decision. If denied, the City shall
state in such notice the factual and/or legal basis upon which the request is denied. If the request is not
denied within the five (5) business day period, it shall be deemed granted.

If the City timely denies the request for independent counsel, the employee may appeal the decision
within five (5) business days of the date on which he or she receives the City's decision by giving
written notice of appeal to the City. The appeal shall be heard by a neutral third person who pos
the knowledge and experience necessary to determine whether a conflict of interest exists and who has
been mutually selected by the City and the Federation. The Parties may present evidence and testimony
before the decision maker. The hearing and review of the decision shall be governed by the Uniform
Arbitration Act, Minnesota Statutes §572.01, et seq.

 

An employee entitled to independent counsel under this Article may select counsel from among the
attorneys on the list approved by the City and the Federation. The Federation shall propose attorneys for
the list subject to approval by the City based on the City's fee schedule. Such approval shall not
unreasonably be withheld. Notwithstanding approval by the City, no firm shall be entitled to be placed
on the list until it has agreed to undertake representation in such matters at the standard hourly rate
negotiated by and among the Federation, the City, and all approved firms. The list of approved
attorneys shall contain not less than three firms.

Recognition, Rights and Responsibilities

Section 9.02 - Assignment of Judgment for Costs
Each defendant represented by City-paid counsel shall assign to the City any judgment for costs or

disbursements awarded in favor of such defendant.

Section 9.03 - Liability Insurance

The City may, at its option, maintain a standard policy of liability insurance covering employees against
the actions and claims referenced in Section 9.01 above. The City shall pay all premiums for such
coverage.

ARTICLE 10
NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PREVENTION

In the application of this Agreement's terms and provisions, no bargaining unit employee shall be
discriminated against in an unlawful manner as defined by applicable City, State and/or Federal law or
because of an employee's political affiliation or membership in the Federation.

The Employer and the Union reaffirm the Employer’s obligation to maintain a work environment which
is hospitable to all employees, managers and supervisors. To that end, the Employer and the Union shall
continue to develop and refine policies that prohibit harassment and abuse in the workplace by any
employee, manager or supervisor. The Employer agrees to investigate all allegations of violations to
that policy. Upon finding that a violation of the policy has occurred, the Employer shall take
appropriate remedial and/or corrective action.

SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

 

ARTICLE 11
SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

This Article shall apply to all members of the bargaining unit, but only as to resolution of grievances and

not to interest arbitration.

Section 11.02 - Grievance Procedure
Grievances shall be resolved in the manner set out below. The City will cooperate with the Federation
to expedite the grievance procedure to the maximum extent practical.

A “grievance” is any matter concerning the interpretation, application, or alleged violation of any

To initiate a grievance, the Federation representative shall, within the time period specified

below, inform the commander in writing on the standard grievance form. If the Federation expressly
requests a discussion with the commander, such discussion shall take place within twenty-one (21) days
after filing the grievance, unless the time is mutually extended.

  

Within twenty-one (21) days after the grievance is filed or the discussion meeting concludes,
whichever is later, the Employer shall give its decision in writing, together with the supporting reasons
to the Federation. Each Step One decision shall be clearly identified as a “Step One Decision.”

The commander shall have the full authority of the Chief to resolve the grievance.

A grievance must be commenced at Step One no later than twenty-one (21) calendar days from the
discovery of the grievable event(s) or from when the event(s) reasonably should have been discovered
discovered by a represented member.

Class action grievances, defined as a grievance involving five (5) or more similarly situated
employees, and disciplinary grievances involving a suspension, demotion or termination shall be filed
at Step Two with no changes to time parameters.
Settlement of Disputes

Subd. 2. Step Two
If the Step One decision is not satisfactory, a written appeal may be filed by the Federation with

the Chief. If the Federation expressly requests a discussion with the Chief, such discussion shall take
place within twenty-one (21) days after filing the grievance appeal, unless the time is mutually extended.

The Chief may request the Director of Employee Services to serve as a mediator between the
Employer and the Federation in an attempt to resolve the grievance, but the Director of Employee
Services shall have no authority to compel either party to make a concession.

Within twenty-one (21) days after the Step Two meeting or receipt of the Step Two appeal,
whichever is later, the Employer shall send a written response to the Federation. The Step Two decision
shall clearly identify that answer as a “Step Two Decision.”

Subd. 3. Step Three, Regular Arbitration
Within twenty-one (21) of the date of the Step Two decision the Federation shall have the right

to submit the matter to arbitration by informing the Director of Employee Services that the matter is to
be arbitrated. If the grievance has progressed to Step Three without the Federation receiving a written
Step Two decision from the Employer in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.04, the
Federation may request that the matter proceed to arbitration by informing the Director of Employee
Services that the matter is to be arbitrated; If, after the matter has been referred to arbitration, the
Federation has not sought to proceed to hearing, the Employer may at any time make a written inquiry
of the Federation as to the status of the grievance. If the Employer makes such inquiry, the Federation
shall have twenty-one (21) days from the date of such inquiry to make a written request to the Director
of Employee Services or his/her designee to assign an arbitrator under the process described below.
Thereafter, the parties shall request from the arbitrator dates for a hearing on the matter. If the
Federation fails to make a timely request that an arbitrator be assigned or, within twenty one (21) days
after receiving notice of the assignment of the arbitrator, does not participate in a good faith effort to
schedule a hearing; the grievance shall no longer be subject to the grievance procedure. If the Employer
fails to assign an arbitrator or, within twenty one (21) days after receiving notice of the assignment of
the arbitrator, does not participate in a good faith effort to schedule a hearing; the grievance shall be
deemed sustained and the requested relief shall be granted.

 

If the matter is to be arbitrated, a single arbitrator shall be selected from the panel of mutually
agreed upon arbitrators maintained in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement attached hereto
as Attachment H. Arbitrators shall be selected from the panel on a rotating basis. If a grievance is
referred to arbitration and no arbitrators on the panel are available to hear the case, the party referring
the grievance to arbitration shall petition the Bureau of Mediation Services to provide a list of seven (7)
qualified arbitrators from which the parties shall select an arbitrator to hear the grievance. The
Employer and Federation shall select an arbitrator using the alternate strike method with the party
exercising the first strike selected by coin flip. In scheduling arbitration hearings, the parties will give
priority to grievances contesting the termination of an employee.

One observer representative of the Federation, the aggrieved member(s), if any, all necessary
Federation witnesses who are employees of the Employer shall receive their regular salary and wages
for the time spent in the arbitration proceeding, if during regular work hours. An additional Federation
observer shall be allowed; however, the Federation shall provide the means for compensating the

Page 8 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Settlement of Disputes

additional observer and his/her replacement employee, if necessary. Federation time may be used to
reimburse the Employer for the replacement employee.

The arbitrator shall render a written decision and the reasons, therefore resolving the grievance,
and order any appropriate relief within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the
submission of briefs by the parties. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding
upon the City, the Federation and the employee(s) affected.

The arbitrator shall have no authority to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from
the provisions of this agreement. The arbitrator is also prohibited from making any decision that is
contrary to law or to public policy.

Section 11.03 - Expedited Arbitration
Upon the mutual agreement of the parties, any grievance to be arbitrated may be referred to expedited

arbitration where the time frame for effective resolution is so short that the normal arbitration procedure
would be untimely. Upon such referral, the Federation and the City will make immediate (within
twenty-four (24) hours) arrangements with the panel selected by the parties, or if none has been selected,
with the Bureau of Mediation Services. The expedited arbitration procedure shall begin as soon as the
parties and the arbitrator can initiate a hearing. It shall be the specific request of both the Federation and
the City to have a decision within seven (7) days of the hearing, and that no briefs will be filed.

Section 11.04 - Time Limits; Communications

Time limits, specified in this procedure may be extended by written mutual agreement of the parties.
When practical, the preferred method of giving notices and communications under this Article shall be
by email. The failure of the City to comply with any time limit herein means that the Federation shall be
deemed to have processed the grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure. Failure of the
Federation or its employees to comply with any time limit herein renders the alleged violation untimely
and no longer subject to the grievance procedure.

 

Notices or communications referenced under this Article shall be given:

 

TO THE EMPLOYER TO THE FEDERATION

Chief of Police Its President

Assistant Chief Its Representative who signed the grievance
Police Administration Secretary Its Office Administrative Assistant

Director of Employee Services

Section 11.05 - Arbitration Expenses
The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be divided equally between the Employer and the

Association provided, however, that each Party shall be responsible for compensating its own
representatives and witnesses. If either Party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it may cause
such record to be made provided it pays for the cost of preparing the record. Further, if the party
requesting the record requests submitting post-hearing briefs, such party shall at its cost provide a copy
of the record to the other Party and to the Arbitrator.

Settlement of Disputes

Section 11.06 - Election of Remedy
The parties acknowledge that the facts and circumstances which form the basis of a grievance may also

form the basis of claims which may be asserted by an individual employee in other forums. The purpose
of this Section is to establish limitations on the right of the Union to pursue a grievance in such
situations.

 

Subd. 1. Civil Service Rights
When the subject matter of a grievance to which Article 11 applies is also within the

jurisdiction of the Minneapolis Civil Service Commission the resolution of the dispute may proceed
through the grievance procedure or the Civil Service appeals procedure. However, once the
employee files an appeal to the Civil Service Commission, the Union's right to pursue a grievance
under this Article is terminated.

Notwithstanding anything in the Civil Service Rules to the contrary, an employee's right to
file an appeal with the Civil Service Commission expires on the later of: ten (10) days after the
deadline for the Union to file a grievance under this Article; or ten (10) days after the employee has
received notice from the Union of its final decision not to pursue a grievance. The Union shall
provide notice to the City of such decision promptly after providing notice to the employee.

Subd. 2. Rights of Veterans
Some employees covered by this Agreement may have the individual right to contest a

removal from a position or employment under Minn. Stat. §197.46. Once an employee requests a
hearing under Minn. Stat. §197.46, the Union's right to pursue a grievance under this Article is
terminated.

 

Subd. 3.Other Rights of Employees
No action by the Union under this Agreement shall prevent an employee from pursuing a

charge of discrimination brought under Title VII, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act.

Section 11.07 - No Waiver of Rights Without Written Agreement
In order to facilitate the resolution of disputes or concerns in a more expedient and non-adversarial

manner, the Parties desire to be able to discuss the resolution of such matters without having such
discussions be construed as a waiver of either the Employer's right to exercise its unabridged managerial
prerogatives or the Federation's right to negotiate over terms and conditions of employment. The parties
acknowledge the holding of the Minnesota Supreme Court in Arrowhead Public Service Union v. City of
Duluth [336 N.W.2d 68 (Minn. 1983), 116 LRRM (BNA) 2187] as follows:

 

  

Without question, decisions concerning a City's budget, its programs and organizational
structure, and the number of personnel it employs to conduct its operations are matters of
[inherent managerial] policy. While a public employer must negotiate terms and
conditions of employment, it is not required to negotiate matters of inherent managerial
policy although it may do so voluntary. When, however, a public employer negotiates
matters of inherent managerial policy which it has no obligation to negotiate and thereby
relinquishes the right to determine policy with respect to its budget, its organizational

Page 10 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Settlement of Disputes

structure and the number of personnel it should employ, the public employer - like the
collective bargaining representative which waives the statutory right to bargain over a
mandatory subject of bargaining - must do so in clear and unmistakable language.
[emph: added; citations omitted]

 

Therefore, it is not a prerequisite to substantive and/or meaningful discussions concerning a matter of
interest to either the Employer or the Federation or the Parties jointly that the Parties agree as to whether
the matter is a term and condition of employment or an inherent managerial policy as those terms are
defined and referenced in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 179A, as amended. The Parties may freely
discuss any such matters and may reach an understanding regarding the extent to which the matter may
be resolved and/or the manner of resolution. However, unless the parties shall enter into a written
agreement which contains clear and unmistakable language documenting a waiver of rights, neither the
mere fact that the Parties had such discussions nor the existence of any understanding regarding
resolution of the matter shall constitute or be construed to be a waiver of either: the Federation's right to
at any time thereafter assert or contest that the matter is a term and condition of employment which is
subject to collective bargaining and which may not be unilaterally imposed; or the Employer's right to at
any time thereafter assert that the matter is one of inherent managerial policy not subject to mandatory
collective bargaining prior to implementation.

 

Section 11.08 - Past Practices
Evidence of custom and past practice may be introduced for the following purposes:

(a) to provide the basis of rules governing matters not included in the written contract;
(b) to indicate the proper interpretation of ambiguous contract language; or

(c) to support allegations that clear language of the written contract has been amended by
mutual action or agreement.

The extent to which such evidence of custom and past practice shall be considered to bind the parties is
governed by generally accepted principles of labor relations applicable to the purpose for which the
evidence is offered.

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
DISCIPLINE

 

ARTICLE 12
DISCIPLINE

Section 12.01 - Just Cause

The City, through the Chief of the Minneapolis Police Department, will discipline employees who have
completed the required probationary period only for just cause. The unit of measurement for any
suspensions which may be assessed shall be in hours. Investigations into an employee's conduct which
do not result in the imposition of discipline shall not be entered into the employee's official personnel
file maintained in the Police Department and/or the City’s Human Resources Department. For the
purposes of this Article, disputes related to personnel file retention and/or reconciliation may be
resolved through the procedures set forth in Article 11, Settlement of Disputes.

Section 12.02 - Appeals
Except as provided in Section 12.05, a suspension, written reprimand, transfer, demotion (except during

the probationary period) or discharge of an employee who has completed the required probationary
period may be appealed through the grievance procedure as contained in Article 11 of this Agreement.
In the alternative, where applicable, an employee may seek redress through a procedure such as Civil
Service, Veteran's Preference, or Fair Employment. Except as may be provided by Minnesota law or by
Section 11.06 of this Agreement, once a written grievance or an appeal has been properly filed or
submitted by the employee or the Federation on the employee's behalf through the grievance procedure
of this Agreement or another available procedure, the employee's right to pursue redress in an alternative
forum or manner is terminated.

Section 12.03 - Personnel Data

Pursuant to the terms and definitions set forth in the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, the
Chief of Police and/or the Human Resources Director or their respective designees shall be the
“responsible authority” with regard to all “personnel data” gathered or maintained by the City with
regard to employees governed by this Agreement. Employees shall receive copies of and be permitted
to respond to all letters of commendation or complaints that are entered and retained in the official
personnel file. Upon the written request of employees, the contents of their official personnel file shall
be disclosed to them, or with formal release, their Federation Representative, and/or their legal counsel.

Section 12.04 - Investigatory Interviews.

(a) Before taking a formal statement from any employee, the City shall provide to the
employee from whom the formal statement is sought a written summary of the events to
which the statement relates. To the extent known to the City, such summary shall
include: the date and time (or period of time if relating to multiple events) and the
location(s) of the alleged events; a summary of the alleged acts or omissions at issue; and
the policies, rules or regulations allegedly violated. Except where impractical due to the
immediacy of the investigation, the summary shall be provided to the employee not less
than two (2) days prior to the taking of his/her statement. If the summary is provided to
the employee just prior to the taking of the statement, the employee shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to consult with a Federation representative before proceeding with
the scheduled statement.
(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

Discipline

In cases where the City believes that providing the pre-statement summary would cause a
violation of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act or cause undue risk of
endangering a person, jeopardizing an ongoing criminal investigation or creating civil
liability for the City, the City shall notify the Federation’s President or attorneys of the
reasons it believes that the pre-statement summary should not be given.

Nothing herein shall preclude an investigator, whether during or subsequent to the taking
of a formal statement, from soliciting information which is beyond the scope of the pre-
statement summary but which relates to information provided during the taking of the
statement and which could form the basis of a disciplinary action.

An employee from whom a formal statement is requested is entitled to have a Federation
representative or an attorney retained by the employee, or both, present during the taking
of such statement. The employee’s representative(s) shall be allowed to advise the
employee but shall not respond for or advocate for the employee nor disrupt the
investigation proceedings. The Federation will ensure that its representatives at all times
conduct themselves in a professional manner.

For the purpose of this Section 12.04, a “formal statement” is a written, recorded or
transcribed record, whether in a narrative form or in response to questions, which is
requested to be provided by any sworn employee as part of an investigation of alleged
acts or omissions by a sworn employee(s) which may result in the imposition of
discipline against any sworn employee(s).

Section 12.05 - Discipline of Personnel With Rights to Return to Bargaining Unit
If a Commander is removed (un-appointed) from the position as the result of discipline, any discipline

shall be imposed while the employee holds the rank of Commander and shall not be imposed after the
employee is removed and returned to his/her last held permanently certified title. Such removal of a
Commander shall not cause the demotion of another employee holding the rank of the last held
permanently certified title and any reduction in the rank shall be by attrition. Further, if discipline is
imposed on a Commander for reasons based on conduct that occurred while serving as a Commander,

the employee shall not have acces

Agreement but may have access to the Civil Service Commission appeal process.

WAGES AND BENEFITS

 

ARTICLE 13
SALARIES

Section 13.01 - Pay Period
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), below, all wages shall be computed and paid on a biweekly

basis. The regular amount of pay shall be the biweekly rate regardless of the number of hours on
duty for that period, provided that the employee is on duty as scheduled or is on authorized paid
leave.

(b) The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that a law enforcement employee be compensated
at one and one-half times his/her “regular rate” for hours worked that exceed 171 hours in a 28-
day pay cycle (“FLSA Overtime Hours”). Certain items of compensation that the FLSA requires
to be included in the calculation of an employee’s “regular rate” may not be known at the time
FLSA Overtime Hours are worked. Therefore, as soon as practical following the conclusion of
each payroll year, the Employer will: review the payroll records for each employee to determine
whether any adjustment to the employee’s regular rate for purposes of FLSA Overtime Hours is
required; and, if so, pay to the employee the balance of amounts owing for the FLSA Overtime

Hours worked by the employee during the preceding payroll year.

Section 13.02 - Wage Schedule

Attached hereto and incorporated herein, are the schedules of wage rates for employees. The effective
date of each schedule shall be as specified on the schedule and as provided in this Section. The final
wage schedule shall remain in effect until a new schedule of wage rates for employees is established by
the written agreement of the Parties.

New salary schedules shall be implemented as follows:

(a) A negotiated effective date of January 1, or a date thereafter up to the first day of the first full
payroll period of the calendar year, shall be implemented as of the first day of the first full payroll
period of the calendar year.

(b) A negotiated effective date on or after the first day of the first full payroll period of the calendar
year shall be implemented as of the first day of the pay period in which the negotiated effective date
falls.

Section 13.03 - Health Care Savings Account Contribution

Effective April 6, 2003 the Parties have adopted the Post Employment Health Care Savings Plan, as
established in Minn. Stat. §352.98, as administered by the Minnesota State Retirement System
(“MSRS”). Subject to the terms and conditions established by MSRS, said program will provide a
totally tax-free reimbursement for eligible medical expenses to those former employees who have an
account balance consisting of the contributions from the Employer, mandatory employee contributions,
and investment returns.
Wages and Benefits

The Parties have negotiated that employees in this bargaining unit will make mandatory employee
contributions in lieu of cash payment for the following items:
¢ $25.00 bi-weekly per employee
e 100% of Sick Leave Severance due at retirement (see Section 28.02);
e 100% of any unused vacation pay at the time of voluntary separation from service (see Section
22.06)

Section 13.04 - Longevity
A longevity payment shall be paid to each employee at the beginning of the seventh year of police

service in the amount specified in the attached wage schedule, as applicable. Employees of record as of
February 1, 1985 shall be regarded as having started at the 2" Year step for longevity progression
purposes. The dollar amounts specified in the wage schedule shall be adjusted by the same percentage
and at the same time as across the board increases in the base wages for the top step of the Police Officer
wage schedule. An employee shall move to the next step in the longevity schedule on the anniversary of
his/her employment with the Police Department.

Section 13.05 - Shift Differential

Employees in the Department who work a scheduled shift in which a majority of the work hours fall
between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., shall be paid a shift differential in the amount specified in
the attached wage schedule for all hours worked on such shifts. The dollar amount specified in the wage
schedule shall be adjusted by the same percentage and at the same time as across the board increases in
the base wages for the seventh step of the Police Officer wage schedule. (See wage schedule for
amount)

Section 13.06 - Pay Progressions
Employees shall be eligible to be considered for advancement to the next higher step within the pay

range for their classification as provided in this Section.
Subd. 1. Police Officer

(a) Lateral Hires. Initial placement on the wage schedule for Police Officers with
prior law enforcement experience shall be made pursuant to Section 13.08.
Thereafter, eligibility for subsequent step progression shall be as established in
subparagraph (c), below.

(b) All Other Police Officers. All other Police Officers shall, upon hire, be placed
on the “Recruit Step” as designated on the attached wage schedule. The
employee shall move to Step 1 of the wage schedule upon successful completion
of the Recruit Academy. Upon the completion of twelve (12) months of actual
paid service at Step 1, the employee shall be eligible to progress to Step 2.
Upon the completion of eight (8) months of actual paid service at Step 2, the
employee shall be eligible to progress to Step 3. Thereafter, eligibility for
subsequent step progression shall be as established in subparagraph (c), below.

(c) Progression. Upon the completion of each twelve (12) months of actual paid
service in a salary step of the wage schedule for the employee’s job

Page 15 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Wages and Benefits

classification, an employee shall be eligible to progress to the next step until
he/she has reached the top step on the schedule.

Subd. 2 Sergeants and Lieutenants
Upon promotion, the employee shall be placed on the salary schedule pursuant to Section 13.07.

Thereafter, eligibility for subsequent step progression shall be as established in subparagraph (c) of
Subd. 1, above.

Subd. 3. Conditions and Implementation for Step Progression

Any such increases under this Section 13.06, may be withheld or delayed in cases where the
employee's job performance has been of a less than satisfactory level in which case the employee shall
be notified that the increase is being withheld or delayed and of the specific reasons therefore. All such
denials or delays shall be subject to review under the provisions of Article 11 (Settlement of Disputes) of
this Agreement. All increases approved pursuant to this Section shall be made effective on the first day
of the pay period, which includes the date of eligibility. If an employee is advanced to the next higher
step within his/her pay range by reason of the elimination of the step he/she was in, the employee’s
anniversary date in the job classification he/she was in at such time shall be permanently adjusted to the
month and day that such step advancement occurred.

 

Section 13.07 - Pay Upon Promotion
The salary of an employee who is promoted to a position which provides for a higher maximum salary

than the employee's current position shall be the next increment higher than the salary last received by
such employee in the lower classification; provided, however, that if the next increment is not at least
four percent (4%) higher than the salary last received, the employee shall be advanced an additional
increment if one so exists and thereafter shall increase in accordance with Section 13.06 of this Article.
The provisions of this subdivision shall also be applicable whenever an employee is detailed by the
Minneapolis Civil Service Commission to perform all or substantially all of the duties of a higher-paid
classification.

 

Section 13.08 - Prior Sworn Law Enforcement Experience

Subd. 1. Hiring Process

Notwithstanding any provision of the Civil Service Rules to the contrary, the Chief may, upon
the prior advice and consent of the Chief Human Resources Officer, use the following process to make
offers of employment for the job classification of Police Officer to applicants with prior sworn law
enforcement experience.

(a) At least twenty (20) days prior to accepting application, a posting shall be made
advertising that the Department is accepting applications from individuals having
prior sworn law enforcement experience. The posting may be made without an
expiration date.

(b) In order to be eligible for hire under this provision, an applicant must be POST
license eligible pursuant to the requirements established by Minn. Stat. §626.8515.

(c) The Chief may determine the minimum qualifications necessary to be considered for
employment and may make an offer of employment to any candidate who meets such
Page 16 of 95
Police Officers Federation ¢ 2017-2019
(d)

(e)

Wages and Benefits

qualifications. However, the minimum qualifications shall not be less than the
minimum qualifications for hiring under the competitive examination process as
established pursuant to Civil Service Rule 6.03.

The Chief may determine the nature and extent of training necessary for a candidate
hired under this Section to become a sworn employee of the Department. The
training need not be the same as the training provided to a newly hired Police Officer
without prior law enforcement experience.

At least thirty (30) days prior to initiating or amending a posting, the minimum
qualifications or the hiring process under this Section, the Chief shall give notice to
the Federation and afford the Federation an opportunity to meet and confer if
requested.

Subd. 2. Salary and Benefits - General

For a new hire with prior experience as a sworn law enforcement officer, the initial placement
on the salary schedule in the classification of Police Officer and on the vacation accrual schedule in
Section 22.02 shall be made as follows:

(a)

(b)

(d)

(e)

(f)

One year of MPD service shall be credited for every two full years of prior service
with a large department or departments.

One year of MPD service shall be credited for every three full years of prior service
with a small department or departments.

“Prior service”, as referenced in subsections (a) and (b) does not include:

i. service to an agency while licensed as part-time officer;

ii. service to an agency for which the employee’s regular work schedule, except
in the case of limitations on work hours for medical reasons, was less than an
average of forty (40) hours per week; or

ili. Military service.

With regard to initial placement on the vacation accrual schedule, no new employee
shall be placed at an initial annual accrual rate higher than 128 hours regardless of the
years of his/her prior service.

The threshold for large/small department is 50 sworn employees as determined by the
most recent FBI “Crime in the United States” annual report.

For purposes of calculating qualified prior years of service, all full calendar months
worked in qualified large or small departments shall be summed before applying the
service credit conversion for that type of jurisdiction (i.e. large or small) as described
in subsections (a) and (b), above.

Page 17 of 95

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Wages and Benefits

(g) The resulting full-credit-years as determined for both large and small departments
shall be added together to determine the total number of years of service credit that
shall be awarded to the new employee.

(h) A break in sworn service longer than six months between any of the prior jurisdiction
jobs shall break the line of eligible work experience from work experience preceding
the 6-month break in service.

(i) Prior service credit will be considered only if the new employee’s last day of active
service in the prior sworn position was within two years of the date of an offer of
employment by the Minneapolis Police Department.

Subd. 3. Salary and Benefits — Minneapolis Park Police

For a new hire with prior experience as a sworn law enforcement officer in the Minneapolis
Police Department (“Park Police’) time served in the Park Police shall be considered the same as “MPD
service” for the purpose of determining the employee’s vacation accrual rate and placement on the
salary schedule. If the Park Police had included prior service credit for time served in the MPD in
determining the employee’s compensation and vacation accrual rate as a Park Police employee, such
prior time served at the MPD shall also be included upon rehire by MPD as “time served in the Park
Police” under the preceding sentence.

 

 

Subd. 4. Step Progression
After initial placement on the salary schedule, the new employee shall be entitled to future step

increases thereafter pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.06.

Subd. 5. Limitation on Application of Prior Service Credit

Prior service credit shall be used only to determine the new employee’s initial placement on the
salary and vacation accrual schedules and shall not be considered for purposes of eligibility for
longevity pay, performance pay, promotion or other rights or benefits of employment which are based
on time served with the MPD. Regardless of whether a new employee is given such prior service credit,
his/her seniority shall be determined consistent with the provisions of Article 3 of this Agreement.

 

Section 13.09 - Performance Management

Subd. 1. Supervisor Responsibilities
Supervisory employees are responsible for

e Assuring that employees perform their jobs consistent with the expectations and values of
the Minneapolis Police Department and the City of Minneapolis;

« Communicating reasonable performance expectations prior to April 1 of each year, and
for documenting and notifying employees of inappropriate conduct as soon after the
conduct as possible, and giving the employee guidance and time to correct behavior; and

e Discussing with and encouraging employees regarding the opportunities for career
enrichment and advancement within the Department, including the benefits of periodic

Page 18 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Wages and Benefits

transfers to broaden an employee’s perspective and experience. However, the transfer of
an employee in a Bid Assignment shall be voluntary, except as provided under Section
16.02, Subd. 3(b) or Section 16.04, Subd. 2. If an employee agrees to such a “career
enrichment” transfer, the transfer shall not cause the displacement of another employee in
the precinct or work group to which the employee is transferred.

Subd. 2. Performance Premium

Effective January 1, 2017, performance premium shall no longer be payable to Police Officers
under this Section. In lieu thereof, as of that date and after the application of the negotiated wage
adjustment effective on that date, the wage schedule for the rank of Police Officer shall be adjusted as
follows: 1% shall be added to each step of the wage schedule; except that 2% shall be added to the top
step of the wage schedule.

Employees in the rank of Sergeant shall be entitled to a lump sum payment upon receiving a
satisfactory or higher performance evaluation using job expectations and performance standards
established by the Chief of Police. The performance evaluation shall be completed with notification of
satisfactory performance sent to payroll by November 15 with the premium being paid by December 31
of each year.

  

The performance premium shall be equal to two percent (2%) of the employee’s base pay,
exclusive of shift differential, overtime or other forms of additional compensation. The performance
premium shall be prorated for each scheduling cycle during which no work was performed for the
majority of the hours which would normally have been scheduled, excluding the use of sick leave,
vacation leave, military leave (payable upon return), documented FMLA leave or compensatory time.

If a supervisor does not conduct a performance evaluation, the employee shall be considered to
have received a satisfactory evaluation. An eligible employee who does not receive a satisfactory
performance evaluation may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the evaluation, appeal the subjective
portions of the evaluation to the appropriate Bureau Head for a final decision. The issue of whether a
performance evaluation was conducted shall be subject to the provisions of Article 11.

Subd. 3. Compensation.

(a) When an employee is detailed under Subd. 1, or working out of class under Subd. 2
for a period of at least five (5) consecutive work days, the employee shall be

Assignments and Scheduling

(b) If a detail used to fill a temporary vacancy terminates by reason of the vacancy being
deemed “permanent” and there is no current list of qualified candidates to fill

days before it becomes effective. A work assignment is “permanent” if it continues for more than thirty
(30) consecutive calendar days. The Change in Shift compensation provisions of Section 18.03
shall not apply in the event of a permanent transfer even though an employee’s work schedule
in the new assignment may differ from his/her posted schedule in the prior assignment. However, if
the Department fails to give the required advance notice of the transfer, all hours worked during the
period commencing with the first day of work after the effective date of the transfer and ending with
the 10" day following the date on which the notice was given, shall be considered Overtime and,
therefore, subject to the provisions of Section 20.02 of this Agreement.

Section 16.06 - Reinstatement of Employees Who Resigned from the Classified Service

A reinstated employee will, upon appointment, begin to accrue seniority rights, vacation eligibility,
sick leave, and other Civil Service rights and benefits the same as any other new employee. Service

salary, but will not be considered for purposes such as: fulfilling in-service time requirements for
competing in promotional examinations; computing seniority in promotional examinations; determining
order of layoffs; determining the order of bids for assignments and vacations; or determining other
priorities among employees.

Following reinstatement, an employee will, upon request, have his/her prior service counted for
the purpose of reaching the minimum years of service requirement to be eligible for the Accrued Sick
Leave Retirement Plan. However, such years of prior service will only be counted after such
employee has accumulated sufficient sick leave credits following reinstatement or re-employment to
meet the minimum sick leave accrual requirements. Prior years of service shall not be applied to an
employee reinstated or re-employed for the second or subsequent time.

Section 16.07 - Appointed Positions

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that pursuant to the
provisions of Laws 1961, Chapter 108, Sections 1 through 4 as amended by Laws 1969, Chapter 604 and

Department may appoint up to five (5) Deputy Chiefs and up to eight (8) Inspectors.

Assignments and Scheduling

Units with multiple watches. For units or work groups that assign employees to
more than one Watch, once per year the employees may, by seniority within the
unit, designate their preference for the watch they will work. However, if the
Employer needs to assign employees to a watch different from the employee’s
preference it may do so. If, after the initial designation:

i. the Employer needs to change the number of employees on a watch, it
may do so by seeking volunteers or applying inverse unit seniority; or

ii. the Employer needs to change an employee’s start time within a watch, it
may do so upon 30-days’ advance notice to the employee.

Canine Unit. On a day for which a canine officer is scheduled to report for duty
to his/her assigned position with the Department, the normal work day shall be a
scheduled shift of nine (9) consecutive hours of work and one (1) hour of canine
maintenance to be performed at the officer’s discretion during his/her non-
scheduled hours. Each canine officer shall also perform one (1) hour of canine
maintenance each day at his/her discretion that his/her canine partner is in
his/her custody even if the officer is not scheduled to work on that day.
Accordingly, when a canine officer is excused from a scheduled work day by
reason of using his/her accumulated sick leave, vacation or comp time on a day
during which he/she will still perform canine maintenance duties, his/her
respective account balance shall be reduced by nine (9) hours.

 

Subd. 4. Reassignment From Discretionary Assignments and Voluntary Details
Reassignment from a Discretionary Assignment or removal from a voluntary detail shall be
made according the same provisions applicable to transfers under Section 17.04, subject to the

following:

Assignment from a Discretionary Assignment so that the employee will be
considered an “Eligible Employee” provided the employee has:
i. fulfilled his/her minimum service requirement; and
ii. given notice of desire to return to a Bid Assignment at least 60 days prior
to the posting of Bid Assignments.

If a suitably trained replacement is not available prior to the Commencement
Date, the employee shall still be allowed to bid for a Bid Assignment but the
reassignment to the Bid Assignment may be delayed until after the
Commencement Date if required by the legitimate business needs of the
Employer.

An employee who has completed the minimum length of service commitment for
a voluntary detail may notify the Department of his/her intention to resign from
the voluntary detail at any time. The Department will honor such request and
relieve the employee of the duties associated with the voluntary detail within one
year of such written notice.

c) The Employer, in its sole discretion, may waive the minimum length of service
requirement for any Discretionary Assignment or voluntary detail.

Section 17.04 - Transfers
A “transfer” is the change, for a period of more than 30 days, of an employee’s assignment to a precinct,
unit or other work group.

Subd. 1. Transfer of Employees in Discretionary Assignments Initiated by the Employer

Subject to the notice requirements of this Article 17, the Employer may, as it deems necessary,
transfer an employee serving in a Discretionary Assignment to any Bid or Discretionary Assignment.
The Department agrees that, upon the request of an employee, it will advise the employee of the
reason for such action.

Subd. 2. Transfer of Police Officers in Bid Assignment Initiated by the Employer

 

(a) Police Officers in a Bid Assignment may be transferred subject to the provisions
of Section 17.02, Subd. 3(b).

(b) The Employer may transfer a Police Officer to another Bid Assignment based on
articulable performance issues as provided in this paragraph (b). The types of
issues which form the basis for a transfer under this provision may include, but
are not limited to:

Behavioral/attitude changes

Conflicts with supervisors/co-workers

Increase in complaints against the employee

Increase in unexplained absenteeism/use of sick leave

Placement of an employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

Before a transfer is made, the employee’s direct supervisor, or another supervisor
after consulting with the direct supervisor, will meet with the employee to discuss
the performance issues. If the supervisor determines that a transfer may be
appropriate under the circumstances, the supervisor will give the employee
written notice as to: the issues that require correction; a reasonable period for the
employee to make the needed corrections; and that he/she may be transferred if
the issues are not corrected within the specified period. The notice is not required
if the employee agrees to a transfer.

Either the supervisor or the employee may request Federation participation in the initial
meeting and any follow-up meetings.

A transfer under this paragraph is not grievable, except that the grievance procedure may
be used for the limited purpose of challenging whether there are any articulable
performance issues and/or whether the employee was given the required notice.

Page 31 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

A transfer under this paragraph neither precludes the imposition of discipline for just
cause nor limits management’s rights to transfer an employee in a Bid Assignment under
Section 17.02, Subd. 3(b).

A transfer under this paragraph will be documented and included in the employee’s
personnel record and the supervisor(s) in the employee’s new assignment will be given
appropriate notice of the circumstances surrounding the transfer.

Subd. 3. Transfers Initiated By the Employee
The Employer acknowledges that its policy is to use reasonable efforts to accommodate a

transfer request by an employee, subject to the following and other applicable terms of this Agreement.

(a)

(b)

(c)

With regard to supervisory personnel (those serving in the rank of Sergeant
and above), nothing shall give the employee an absolute right to transfer from one
assignment to another and the Employer is under no obligation to grant a transfer
request.

With regard to personnel having the rank of Police Officer, the Department will
generally honor a transfer request provided that the employee has satisfied any
applicable minimum length of service requirements in his/her present
assignment and the transfer will not unduly disrupt the operations of the
Department. As an additional measure to facilitate transfers, the Federation will
maintain a transfer request list for each precinct. An employee may place his/her
name, and any two employees may place their names together, on the transfer list
on a “first come, first serve” basis. When a Bid Assignment posted as vacant is
not claimed under Section 17.02, Subd. 4(c), transfer offers will be made to from
such transfer list. If an employee(s) declines a transfer offer, his/her/their name(s)
shall be removed from the list. An employee(s) may remove his/her/their name(s)
from the list at any time. If an employee(s) declines a transfer offer, his/her/their
name(s) shall be removed from the list. An employee may only be on one transfer
list at a time.

 

The Employer, in its sole discretion, may waive the minimum length of service
requirement for any Discretionary Assignment.

Subd. 4. Minneapolis Park Police Department

A Park Police officer may be hired as a Minneapolis Police Officer under Section 13.08 (“Prior
Sworn Law Enforcement Experience”) but may not transfer from the Minneapolis Park Police Department

specific assignment shall be eight (8) or ten (10) hours, except that the normal workday for
all Bid Assignments shall be ten (10) hours.

 

b. The normal work period shall be one hundred sixty (160) hours of work in each twenty-eight
(28) day scheduling period.

Section 18.02 - Work Schedules

Page 33 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

c. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as a limitation or restriction upon the
Department respecting the scheduling of employees and/or the operation of the
Department in Public Safety emergency situations as declared by the Chief of
Police or the Mayor of the City of Minneapolis.

d. Compensation.

1. Employees in a Bid Assignment. For employees in a Bid Assignment,
hours worked that are different from the employee’s bid shift (including
any hours which would have fallen within the posted schedule had no such
departure been made) shall be compensated at the overtime rate as
provided in Section 20.02.

2. Employees in a Discretionary Assignment. For employees in a
Discretionary Assignment, hours worked that are different from the
employee’s posted 28-day work schedule (including any hours which
would have fallen within the posted schedule had no such departure been
made) shall be compensated at the overtime rate as provided in Section
20.02.

3. Limitation on Compensation With 14-Days’ Advance Notice. When the
employer changes the hours of work for a block of consecutive scheduled
work days after the posting of the 28-day schedule for reasons other than
training or a voluntary change, the change of shift compensation shall be
payable only for the first day of the block of consecutive work days
provided the employer gives the employee written notice of the change not
less than 14 days in advance.

4. Change of Shift Compensation Paid in Cash. All change of shift
compensation shall be payable in cash. An employee may not elect to be
compensated in compensatory time for change of shift compensation.
However, if an employee otherwise becomes entitled to overtime for
working hours departing from the changed work schedule, such overtime
shall be subject to all provisions of Article 20.

Subd. 2. Exceptions to the General Rule — Special Circumstances

 

a. Training

1. Prior to Posting Schedule. If the Employer gives an employee written
notice of a change in the employee’s normal hours of work prior to the
posting of the 28-day work schedule, there shall be no compensation if the
change is to accommodate required training for the employee.

2. After Posting Schedule. After the 28-day schedule is posted, the employer
may change the hours of work on a scheduled work day without
compensation to accommodate required training for the employee,

Page 34 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

provided the employer gives the employee at least 14 days advance
written notice.

b. Voluntary Changes

1. No change of shift compensation is payable for changing an employee’s
hours of work or days of work if the change is voluntary. “Voluntary”
means: a request initiated by an employee; or a request initiated by the
employer for which an employee may decline without sanction.

2. Changes for “Career Enrichment Assignments” are considered voluntary.

3. The employer shall grant a shift-change request made by an employee
who is on limited duty status resulting from a qualified IOD injury when
such request is to allow the employee to attend physical therapy or a
medical appointment relating to the injury during on-duty time.

c. Fitness for Duty. Where an unplanned and immediate temporary change in shift
is made necessary because of issues relating to the employee’s physical or mental
fitness for duty, the Department may, at its sole discretion:

1. change the employee’s assignment and work schedule and pay the
compensation specified in the Section 18.03, Subd. 1;

2. change the employee’s assignment using the same hours as specified on
the employee’s posted schedule thereby avoiding the obligation to pay
additional compensation; or

3. offer the employee another assignment with different hours which, if
accepted, would be considered a voluntary change in shift for which no
additional compensation is payable. If the Employee declines such offer,
he/she may take unpaid leave or paid leave to the extent of the employee’s
applicable accrued benefits.

 

d. Investigations. Where an unplanned and immediate temporary change in shift is
made necessary because the employee is under investigation for alleged
misconduct, the Department may, at its sole discretion:

1. change the employee’s assignment and work schedule and pay the
compensation specified in the above Section 18.03, Subd. 1;

2. change the employee’s assignment using the same hours as specified on
the employee’s posted schedule thereby avoiding the obligation to pay
additional compensation; or

3. offer the employee another assignment with different hours which, if
accepted, would be considered a voluntary change in shift for which no

Page 35 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

additional compensation is payable. If the Employee declines such offer,
he/she may take unpaid leave or paid leave to the extent of the employee’s
applicable accrued benefits.

Any compensation payable under this Section 18.03, Subd. 2(d) may be held in abeyance until
the conclusion of the investigation and the final resolution of any resulting disciplinary action. If
a disciplinary action resulting in a penalty more severe than a letter of reprimand is sustained, the
Department shall be relieved of any obligation to pay such compensation.

ARTICLE 19
NEW HIRES AND PROMOTIONS

Section 19.01 - Probationary Period for New Hires
While assigned and compensated as a “recruit”, a Police Officer shall always be on probation and shall

be limited to those duties directed and assigned by the Chief. Upon successful completion of the Recruit
Academy, or upon initial hire through the Lateral Hiring Process in Section 13.08, an employee shall
serve a probationary period of twelve (12) full months of actual work.

Section 19.02 - Promotions

a. Examinations. Promotional examinations, as defined in Civil Service Rule 6.05, shall be
offered to current sworn employees in the classified service who meet minimum
qualifications to compete for promotion to the classes of sergeant, lieutenant or captain.
Promotional examinations under the Civil Service Rules shall not be required for promotion
to the class of Commander. The Human Resources (HR) Department shall be responsible
for developing job-related examination components for all promotional examinations. In
doing so, the HR Department will involve the police administration and the Federation to
ensure the components consist of bona fide occupational qualifications. Examinations may
consist of one or more of the following components: written test, oral interview, rating of
education, skills, and/or experience, practical/work sample, performance history, physical
performance, or other components so long as they have been discussed with the police
administration and the Federation. The HR Department retains the discretion to establish
the examination components and the relative weight of each component. The candidates
advancing to successive components in the examination may be restricted to the most highly
qualified candidates. Once the components and/or criteria are posted and applications are
received, the Employer shall not deviate from the declaration without a legitimate business
reason and after providing proper notice and rationale to the Federation for comment and to
the candidates. Matters related to unilateral changes in the criteria and/or components after
receiving applications shall be subject to Expedited Arbitration as defined in Section 11.06,
notwithstanding the “mutual agreement” provisions.

 

b. Disqualification. The Human Resources Department may refuse to examine, refuse to
certify, or remove from a list of eligible candidates an individual in accordance with the
provisions of Civil Service Rules 6.12 and 7.04

c. Ties. Whenever two or more candidates have the same score on the overall examination, the

Page 36 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

Human Resources Department may break the tie in accordance with the provisions of Civil
Service Rule 6.13.

d. Eligibility Lists. The Human Resources Department may determine the expiration date of a
list of eligible candidates for the classes of sergeant, lieutenant and captain. The expiration
date for the list of eligible candidates shall be provided on the job posting for these classes.

 

 

e. Ranking of Eligible Candidates. Eligible candidates for the classifications of sergeant,
lieutenant and captain shall be ranked from highest to lowest based upon their composite
examination score.

f. Certification; Rule of 3. Upon receiving a requisition to fill a vacancy, the Human
Resources Department will certify and send to the Department the names of the three top-
ranking eligible candidates for a single vacancy and one additional person by rank order for
each additional vacancy. Certification shall be made first from a layoff list generated from
abolishment of a position, then from a medical layoff list and then from the examination list.

g. Probation. Employees promoted to a different job class must serve a probationary period of
six months of actual work in the promoted cl. Completion of probation requires working
six full months under the direct control and supervision of an MPD supervisor. However,
temporary service in a position immediately preceding certification to that position,
without interruption, shall count towards satisfaction of the probationary period. When
an employee is promoted to the rank of Sergeant, the employee shall complete a three (3)
month orientation program before the probationary period begins. The purpose of the
orientation program is to provide the employee with an introduction to duties he/she may
be assigned to perform in the rank of Sergeant but may not have experienced while a
Police Officer. As a component of the orientation program, the employee shall serve at
least one month in an assignment where the primary duties are investigations and at least
one month in an assignment where the primary duties are supervising Police Officers.

 

Because the promotion or change to a different job class requires employees to demonstrate
different job skills or assume additional responsibilities, their job performance in the new
classification is to be evaluated by the Department as if they were new employees.
Employees who demonstrate inappropriate conduct or are substandard in the performance of
their new responsibilities are subject to removal and reassignment to the classification in
which they served before promotion. Such action taken prior to the completion of probation
is not grievable.

  

 

However, employees who exhibit misconduct or who are substandard in the performance of
their responsibilities for reasons which would also affect their performance in the prior job
may be subject to disciplinary action up to discharge. Permanent employees may grieve
such actions.

Section 19.03 - Promotional Exams
When an employee is scheduled to take a Minneapolis Civil Service promotional examination during his
or her regular scheduled hours of duty, the City shall grant reasonable time off to take the examination

 

Page 37 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

except in emergencies as declared by the Chief of Police and the Mayor of Minneapolis. If such an
emergency occurs, the City shall request the Civil Service Commission to reschedule the examination.

ARTICLE 20
OVERTIME

Section 20.01 - Overtime

This Article is intended to define and provide the basis for the calculation of overtime pay or
compensatory time off, as applicable. Nothing herein shall be construed as a guarantee of overtime
work. All employees may be required to work overtime.

Section 20.02 - Overtime and Overtime Pay

Subd. 1. Definition of Overtime

Overtime is defined as any hours of work which deviate from an employee's posted work
schedule as described in Section 18.02 of this Agreement unless such deviation is voluntary on the part
of the employee or is made necessary by required training activities as provided under Section 18.03,
Subd. 2(a) (Temporary Change in Shifts).

Subd. 2. General Rules for Overtime Work

(a) All overtime, with the exception of off-duty arrest and extension of duty to
perform required job functions, must be approved prior to the employee
working the overtime.

(b) When an employee requests compensation for overtime worked and the
Employer disputes whether the employee is entitled to compensation for
such hours or to compensation for such hours at the overtime rate, the Employer
shall notify the employee of the denial of the compensation request. The
Employer shall not change an employee’s hours in the timekeeping or payroll
system without timely notice to the employee.

(c) The department does not generally allow officers of a higher rank to work in an
overtime capacity for officers of a lower rank. However, in instances where it
becomes necessary for an officer to backfill for an officer in a lower rank taking
compensatory time off under Section 20.02, Subd. 5, the officer of higher rank
shall always be compensated in cash at 1.5 times the hourly rate for the top step
of the wage schedule for the rank of the position being filled.

Subd. 3. Overtime Compensation

(a) Employee Discretion. Except as otherwise specified in this Article, an employee
shall be entitled to elect to receive compensatory time off in lieu of cash
payment for overtime at any time the employee’s compensatory time bank is
fifty (50) hours or less.

Page 38 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
(b)

Assignments and Scheduling

When an employee works overtime for which the employee may elect to be
compensated in cash or compensatory time off:

i. If the employee elects cash, he/she shall be compensated for such
overtime at the rate of one and one-half (1/2) times the employee's
regular hourly rate.

ii. If the employee elects compensatory time, one and one-half (1/2) hours
of compensatory time shall be accrued for each hour of overtime
worked.

Employer Discretion. If the employee’s compensatory time bank is more than
fifty (50) hours, the Employer shall have the discretion to decide whether to
grant or deny a request to receive additional compensatory time off for
overtime work.

Subd. 4. Payment of Accumulated Compensatory Time

 

When an employee is promoted to the rank of lieutenant or above, the Employer, in its sole
discretion, may liquidate all or any portion of the employee’s entire compensatory time bank by paying
the employee such hours at his/her current hourly rate (the rate in effect immediately prior to the
promotion). When an employee separates from service, the Employer shall liquidate all of the
employee’s entire compensatory time bank by paying the employee for such hours at his/her current
hourly rate (the rate in effect immediately prior to separation).

Subd. 5. Taking Compensatory Time Off

(a)

(b)

Prior to Scheduling Deadline. Except as provided in subparagraph (d), below, an
employee who gives notice of the intent to use compensatory time at prior to the
deadline for requesting days off shall be granted compensatory time off in
increments of a full shift on the requested date(s) without regard to whether
granting such request would cause the employee’s shift, precinct, unit or division
to fall below the Department’s minimum staffing levels.

After Scheduling Deadline. Except as provided in subparagraph (d), a request
under this subparagraph (b) shall be granted to an employee under the following
conditions:

i. the employee has given notice of the intent to use compensatory time at
least seven (7) days prior to the requested day off;

ii. the request is for a single full shift or not more than two non-consecutive
full shifts;

iii. an employee shall not be granted more than two shifts off under this
paragraph (b) within the 28-day scheduling cycle;

iv. the request will not cause the employee’s shift, precinct, unit or division
to fall below the lesser of: one below the minimum staffing level for the
requested shift as noted on the posted schedule; or one below the
scheduled staffing for the requested shift as noted on the posted schedule.

Page 39 of 95

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

Even if the conditions in subparagraphs i. through iii. are satisfied,
approval of a compensatory time off request is not required if scheduled
staffing is below minimum staffing because of absences caused by the use
of compensatory time or Federation time.

(c) Supervisor Discretion. The Employer retains the sole discretion to grant or
deny requests to take compensatory time off when the request is made:

e after the employee has already been granted two requests made after the
posting of the 28-day schedule but 7 days in advance; or

e on less than 7 days’ advance notice; or

e for less than a full shift off; or

¢ when the request would reduce staffing below the levels referenced in
paragraph (b).

However, it is the policy of the Employer to accommodate requests for
compensatory time off when granting such request would not cause the
employee’s shift, precinct, unit or division to fall below the Department’s
consistently applied minimum staffing levels.

(d) Exception. An advance request for compensatory time off may be denied for
days on which days off and vacations have been cancelled for all of the

personnel in the employee’s shift, precinct, unit or division.

Section 20.03 - Special Overtime Practices

 

Subd. 1. Filling Shifts For Employees Using Compensatory Time.
Overtime worked by an employee to backfill for another employee who is using compensatory
time off shall always be compensated in cash.

Subd. 2. Call-Back Minimum

Employees called to work during scheduled off-duty hours shall be compensated at the rate of
one and one-half (1%) hours for each hour worked with a minimum of four (4) hours' earned for each
such call to work. The minimum of four (4) hours shall not apply when such a call to work is an
extension of or early report to a scheduled shift. This provision shall not apply to situations arising out
of Section 18.03, Temporary Change in Shifts.

Subd. 3. Standby
Employees properly authorized and required by Department rules to standby for duty shall be
compensated at the rate of one (1) times the regular hourly rate, except as specified in Subd. 4 or the
attached Memorandum of Agreement regarding standby status for specialized investigators. Time shall
be calculated to the nearest one-half (2) hour. If standby status is canceled prior to 6:00 p.m. on the day
preceding the scheduled standby status, the Department shall not be obligated to compensate an
employee for standby status. If standby status is canceled after 6:00 p.m. on the day preceding the
scheduled standby status, but before 9:00 a.m. on the day of the scheduled standby status, the
Department shall be required to compensate the employee for one (1) hour of standby. If standby status
is canceled after 9:00 a.m. on the day of the scheduled standby status, the Department shall be required

Page 40 of 95

  

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling
to compensate the employee for the greater of: two (2) hours of standby; or the compensation specified
under this Subd. 3 for time actually served on standby status.

The City shall have three business days to approve or deny the Officer’s request for compensation. If
not denied within three business days of an Officer’s request for any court related compensation, such
compensation shall be deemed approved.

Subd. 4. Court, Court Standby, OPCR and Preparation

 

a. Court and OPCR. Employees will be compensated for all time required in court or
proceedings of the Civilian Review Authority, including time required in standby status
in anticipation of such appearances when:

i. The court case is within the scope of the employee's employment and the
employee is under subpoena or trial notice for the appearance, a copy of which
has been provided to the Department; or

ii. The employee's appearance is required by the OPCR.

Such compensation shall be at the overtime rate for hours that occur outside the
employee’s posted work schedule. The form of compensation for hours compensable at
the overtime rate shall governed by Section 20.02, Subd. 3.

b. Consultation with Attorneys. An employee will be permitted necessary time in
consultation with attorneys while on-duty, provided the case is within the scope of the
employee's employment and, prior approval of such on-duty consultation is received
from the employee's immediate supervisor. Employees shall be compensated for all off-
duty time spent in consultation with attorneys where:

i. The City (i.e., the Minneapolis City Attorney, an involved county attorney and/or
federal authority) requires the employee's attendance at such meeting, and

ii. The consultation cannot reasonable be rescheduled to the involved employee's
normal on-duty hours, and

iii. The same scope of employment and prior approval criteria outlined in Paragraph
b., above, are satisfied.

Subd. 5. Employees Serving in Other Agencies by Contract

The City may enter into an agreement with other law enforcement agencies or other
governmental agencies, for the purpose of authorizing employees covered under this Agreement to
provide services at the direction of such other agency. An employee who participates in such a
program remains an employee of the City. Therefore, such an employee is subject to the rules and
regulations of the Department and is entitled to the rights and benefits of this Agreement; except as
follows:

 

 

Page 41 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

a. such assignment shall be considered “voluntary” so that the scheduling and shift
change provisions of Sections 18.02 and 18.03 shall not apply; and

b. the employee shall obtain prior approval of his/her supervisor in the Minneapolis
Police Department before working overtime which would result in compensation
to the employee in excess of any amount for which the agency to which he/she is
assigned is obligated by contract to reimburse the City.

c. All overtime earned in conjunction with such assignment shall be compensated in
cash.

Subd. 6. Field Training Officers

An employee who serves as a Field Training Officer (FTO) shall receive compensation for the
duties associated with the FTO assignment, in addition to the employee’s regular compensation for
the hours actually worked, for each work day or part thereof in which he/she/she acts as an FTO
with the responsibilities for reporting on the performance of the trainee. The employee may elect to be
compensated for each FTO day by either: one and one-quarter (1/4) hours of compensatory time; or two
(2) hours cash compensation at his/her regular hourly rate. Such election shall be made at the beginning
of the FTO program, or as soon thereafter as is practical, and shall be irrevocable for the duration of the
FTO program for that class of recruits. The Department will attempt to staff its FTO program with
volunteers, but reserves the right to reject a volunteer who it determines is not appropriate to serve as an
FTO and to assign employees to FTO duties if the needs of the Department cannot be fully staffed by
volunteers. The Department will use its best efforts to reasonably limit the number of consecutive
months during which it will involuntarily assign an employee to FTO duties.

 

 

Subd. 7. Buy-Back Policing

Participation in the Department's Buy-Back is voluntary. An employee who works buy back
shall be paid cash compensation for all hours worked therein at one and one-half (1 1%) times the
employee’s regular hourly rate or, if working under the contract between Hennepin County and the
Department for the detox van or a contract between the Department and an officially recognized
community organization under the Neighborhood Revitalization Program, the rate specified in such
contract.

For purposes of this unique overtime practice, Buy-Back Policing shall mean community crime
prevention, special investigative, and other law enforcement activities normally within the scope of the
authority conferred upon the Department by the City Charter. Additional activities may be added only
upon the express written agreement of the Parties.

Buy-back opportunities shall be available to all employees in the ranks of Police Officer,
Sergeant and Lieutenant on a non-discriminatory, consistent basis. Each precinct shall maintain a
system of posting buy-back opportunities that includes a description of the duties and the available dates
and times so that any interested and eligible employee can sign-up for such duties. The employer shall
designate a precinct affiliation for non-precinct employees who desire to work buy-back assignments.
Buy-back assignments shall be available, subject to reasonable restrictions to ensure fairness to all
eligible employees, on a “first-come, first-served” basis among the employees working at or affiliated
with the posting precinct. If the buy-back assignments cannot be filled from within the precinct, the

Page 42 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Assignments and Scheduling

employer may fill such assignments by providing an equal opportunity for volunteers from outside the

precinct.

Subd. 8. Canine Maintenance Compensation

a.

Canine Maintenance Premium. As compensation for the additional canine
maintenance duties associated with the assignment to canine officer, an employee
who serves as a canine officer shall be paid in cash as follows with regard to the one
(1) hour of required canine maintenance: on a day on which a canine officer is
scheduled to work, the one (1) hour shall be paid at straight time (one times the
officer’s regular hourly rate); and on a day that the officer is not scheduled to work,
the officer shall be paid at the premium rate of one and one-quarter (1 4) times the
officer’s regular hourly rate.

Veterinary Care. Time spent in obtaining veterinary care for a canine shall be treated
as hours worked. A canine officer shall use his/her best efforts to arrange for
veterinary care during his/her scheduled duty time. However, if the time of day
during which the officer is obtaining veterinary care departs from his/her posted work
schedule, such departure shall be considered as a “voluntary change of shift” under
Section 18.03, Subd. 2(b) of the Labor Agreement.

Canine Squad Cars. The parties acknowledge that to facilitate transportation of a
canine and to provide an additional benefit to canine officers for canine maintenance
at home and during off-duty hours, canine officers shall be provided with a squad car
that may be used to transport the officer and his/her canine between work and home.
The Department retains the discretion to determine the type of vehicle and the
equipment installed thereon, except that the vehicle and equipment shall be consistent
with Department standards for use in marked patrol and 911 response.

Subd. 9. Holidays

When an employee works “overtime,” as defined by Section 20.02, Subd. 1, on one of the
”*Major Holidays” as defined by Section 23.03, or as an extension of a shift that begins on a Major
Holiday; the effective rate of pay for such overtime hours is 2.25 times the employee’s normal (non-
holiday) hourly rate. The employee may, subject to the provisions of Section 20.02, elect to receive
cash or compensatory time for overtime worked on a holiday.

Section 20.04 - No Duplication of Overtime
Compensation shall not be paid more than once for the same hours under any provision of this

Agreement.

LAYOFF AND RECALL

 

ARTICLE 21
LAYOFF AND RECALL FROM LAYOFF

Section 21.01 - Layoffs and Bumping
Whenever it becomes necessary because of lack of funds or lack of work to reduce the number of

employees in any rank, the Chief of Police shall immediately report such pending layoffs to the City
Coordinator or his/her designated representative. The status of involved employees shall be determined
by the following provisions and the involved employees will be notified.

Definitions.

1. A “lay off’ is when an employee loses his/her position due to a lack of funds or
work even if the action results in the demotion of the employee rather than
interruption of his/her employment.

2. “Bumping” is when an employee who is laid off exercises his/her right to take a
position in a lower rank from an employee with less Classification seniority.

Subd. 1. General Order of Layoff
Layoffs shall be made in the following manner:

(1) Permit employees shall be first laid off;

(2) Temporary employees (those certified to temporary positions) shall next be laid
off;

(3) Persons appointed to permanent positions shall then be laid off.

Subd. 2. Layoff Based on Classification Seniority
The employee first laid off shall be the employee who has the least amount of classification

seniority in the rank in which reductions are to be made. Provided, however, employees retained must
be deemed qualified to perform the required work and employees who possess unique skills or
qualifications which would otherwise be denied the Employer may be retained regardless of their
relative seniority standing.

Subd. 3. Bumping
Employees above the rank of Police Officer who are laid off shall have their names placed on a

demotion list for their classification. Such employees who have at least two (2) years of City seniority
shall have the right to displace (bump) the employee of lesser City seniority who was last certified to the
next lower rank previously held permanently by the laid off employee. If the laid off employee cannot
properly displace any employee in the next lower rank, such laid off employee shall have the right to
displace (bump) the employee of lesser City seniority who was the last certified to progressively lower
ranks previously held permanently by the laid off employee and in which job performance was deemed
by the Employer to be satisfactory. In all cases, however, the bumping employee must meet the current
minimum qualifications of the claimed position and must be qualified to perform the required work.
Layoff and Recall

Section 21.02 - Notice of Layoff
The Employer shall make every reasonable effort under the circumstances to provide affected

employees with at least fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice prior to the contemplated effective date of a
layoff.

Section 21.03 - Recall from Layoff
A Police Officer who has been laid off may be reemployed without examination in a vacant position of

the same rank within three (3) years of the effective date of the layoff. Failure to receive an appointment
within three (3) years will result in the eligible's name being removed from the layoff list. However, the
eligibility of an employee on the layoff list shall be extended for a period of military service while laid
off upon notice to the Employer by the employee of such military service. An employee who was laid
off and had his/her name placed on a demotion list shall be entitled to return to the job classification
from which he/she was laid off before a vacancy in such job classification is filled from a promotional
list.

Section 21.04 - Effect on Appointed Positions
Employees who hold a rank within the classified service but are serving in an unclassified or appointed

position within the City cannot be displaced (bumped) within the meaning of this Article by other
bargaining unit employees during the time such employees hold their appointed positions. Subject to the
provisions of Section 12.05, in the event such a person is removed (un-appointed) from his/her
appointed position he/she shall have the right to return to his/her last-held civil service rank. The return
of such person shall not result in the removal (bumping) of another person in such rank. To the extent
such removal causes there to be an excess above the authorized strength at such rank, the excess shall be
reduced through attrition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Commander is removed by reason of the
elimination of a Commander position(s) as part of a department-wide reduction in staffing that includes
a reduction in the number of personnel in the ranks of Lieutenant, Sergeant and/or Police Officer due to
budgetary reasons, the “attrition” requirement of the preceding sentence shall not apply.

  

 

Section 21.05 - Exceptions
The following exceptions may be observed:

(a) Mutual Agreement. If the Employer and the Federation agree upon a basis for layoff and
reemployment in a certain position or group of positions and such agreement is approved
by the City Coordinator or his/her designated representative, employees will be laid off
and reemployed upon that basis.

a. Emergency Retention. Regardless of the priority of layoff, an employee may be retained on an
emergency basis for up to fourteen (14) calendar days longer to complete an assignment.

position. For purposes of this Article, continuous years of service shall be determined in accordance

with the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Credit During Authorized Leaves of Absence. Time on authorized leave of absence
without pay, except to serve in an unclassified position, shall not be credited toward years
of service, but neither shall it be considered to interrupt the periods of employment before
and after leave of absence, provided an employee has accepted employment to the first
available position upon expiration of the authorized leave of absence.

Credit During Involuntary Layoffs. Employees who have been involuntarily laid off
shall be considered to have been continuously employed if they accept employment to the
first available position. Any absence of twelve (12) consecutive months will not be
counted toward years of service for vacation entitlement.

Credit During Periods on Disability Pension. Upon return to work, employees shall be
credited for time served on workers' compensation or disability pension as the result of
disability incurred on the job. Such time shall be used for the purpose of determining the
amount of vacation to which they are entitled each year thereafter.

leaves of absence shall be entitled to vacation credit as provided in applicable Minnesota
statutes.

Section 22.03 - Vacation Accruals and Calculation
The following shall be applicable to the accrual and usage of accrued vacation benefits:

 

a. Accruals and Maximum Accruals. Vacation benefits shall be calculated on a direct
proportion basis for all hours of credited work other than overtime and without regard to
the calendar year. Benefits may be cumulative up to and including four hundred (400)
hours. Accrued benefits in excess of four hundred (400) hours shall not be recorded and
shall be considered lost.

b. Negative Accruals Permitted. Employees certified to permanent positions shall be
allowed to accrue a negative balance in their vacation account. Such amount shall not
exceed the anticipated earnings for the immediately succeeding twelve (12) month
period. The anniversary date for increase in such employee's vacation allowance shall be
January 1, of the year in which the employee's benefit level is changed. Employees
separating from the service will be required to refund vacation used in excess of accrual
at the time of separation, if any. Effective upon ratification by both parties, this provision
shall be repealed and negative vacation accruals shall no longer be allowed. The
Employer shall develop and implement a plan to reduce negative balances to zero with
input from the Federation.

c. Vacation Usage and Charges Against Accruals. Vacation shall begin on the first working
day an employee is absent from duty. When said vacation includes a holiday, the holiday
will not be considered as one of the vacation days.

d. Vacation Credit Pay. All bargaining unit employees shall be entitled to elect to receive
compensation for vacation time that will be earned in the subsequent year in accordance
with the terms of this paragraph. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of
the payroll year during which the vacation subject to such election is accrued (hereafter
the “Accrual Year”):

i. All employees may elect to receive payment for up to forty (40) hours of vacation
time that will be accrued during the Accrual Year.

ii. Effective with regard to the 2017 election to receive payment for vacation to be
accrued during 2018, and continuing thereafter; employees who accrue at least
128 hours per year or who have at least 120 hours in their vacation account as of
the time of the election may elect to receive payment for up to eighty (80) hours
of vacation time that will be accrued during the Accrual Year.

Such election, once made, shall be irrevocable. Thus, the hours elected for compensation
shall not be eligible for use as vacation. Payment to the employee who has elected to
receive payment shall be based on the employee’s regular base rate of pay in effect on
December 31 of the Accrual Year. The vacation credit pay shall be paid to the employee
within sixty (60) days after the end of the Accrual Year. Employees, at their sole option,
may authorize and direct the Employer to deposit vacation credit pay to a deferred

Page 47 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

compensation plan administered by the Employer provided such option is exercised in a
manner consistent with the provisions governing regular changes in deferred
compensation payroll deductions.

Section 22.04 - Vacation Pay Rates

Subd. 1. Normal

The rate of pay for vacations shall be the rate of pay employees would receive had they been
working at the position to which they have been permanently certified, except as provided in Subd. 2,
below.

Subd. 2. Detailed Employees

Employees on detail (working out of class) for a period of less than thirty (30) calendar days
immediately prior to vacation will be paid upon the basis of the position to which they have been
permanently certified. Employees on detail for more than thirty (30) calendar days immediately prior to
vacation will be paid upon the basis of the position to which they have been detailed.

Section 22.05 - Scheduling Vacations
Vacations are to be scheduled in advance and taken at such reasonable times as approved by the

employee's immediate supervisor with particular regard for the needs of the Employer, the seniority of
employee in his/her rank, and, insofar as practicable, the wishes of the employee. No vacation shall be
assigned by the Employer or deducted from the employee's account as disciplinary action. Effective
upon ratification of this Agreement by both parties, a vacation request may only be approved to the
extent that the employee has sufficient time in his/her vacation account.

Section 22.06 - Payment for Unused Vacation on Separation
The value of any vacation balance due upon voluntary separation shall be deposited into the employees

Post Employment Health Care Savings Plan, as established in Minn. Stat. §352.98 as administered by
the Minnesota State Retirement System.

ARTICLE 23
HOLIDAYS

Section 23.01 — General

Subd. 1. Holidays
Each permanent, full-time employee shall be entitled to eleven (11) days’ leave per year in lieu

of taking holidays off with pay. Such Holiday Leave will be used as directed by the Chief of Police in
the current year giving reasonable consideration to the request of the employee. The days observed as
paid holidays for all permanent, full-time employees are as follows:

New Year’s Day

Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
President’s Day

Memorial Day
Independence Day

Page 48 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

Labor Day

Indigeonous Peoples Day (Columbus Day)
Veterans Day

Thanksgiving Day

Day after Thanksgiving

Christmas Day

The employer retains the right to require employees to work on holidays. If an employee is scheduled to
work on the holiday, the employer shall schedule a day off with pay as an alternate holiday for the
employee during the same 28-day scheduling period as the actual holiday. At the employer’s sole
discretion, it may pay the employee in cash for one normal workday in lieu of scheduling an alternate
day off.

Employees who are eligible for holiday pay shall also receive two (2) floating holidays per calendar
year. Floating holidays may not be carried over if not used during the calendar year.

Subd. 2. Federation Leave

In lieu of an additional holiday for employees, the Employer will donate time to the Federation’s
Donated Time Account referenced in Section 25.03(g)(6) for each employee of record as of the first day
of the first payroll period of each year as follows:

10 hours for each Police Officer
8 hours for each Sergeant
8 hours for each Lieutenant

Section 23.02 - Religious Holidays
An employee may observe religious holidays which do not fall on the employee's regularly scheduled

day off. Such religious holidays shall be taken off without pay unless: 1) the employee has accumulated
vacation benefits available in which case the employee shall be required to take such holidays as
vacation; or 2) the employee obtains supervisory approval to work an equivalent number of hours (at
straight-time rates of pay) at some other time during the calendar year. The employee must notify the
Employer at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of his/her religious holiday of his/her intent to
observe such holiday. The Employer may waive this ten (10) calendar day requirement if the Employer
determines that the absence of such employee will not substantially interfere with the department's
function.

Section 23.03 - Compensation for Work on Holidays.

Subd. 1. Major Holidays

The “regular hourly rate” for all hours worked during any shift which begins on Memorial Day,
Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day (the “Major Holidays”) is 1.5 times
the employee’s hourly rate in effect for work days other than such holidays. The additional
compensation payable for working on a Major Holiday shall be payable in cash. Compensation for
overtime worked on a Major Holiday is subject to the provisions of Section 20.03, Subd. 9.

Subd. 2. Other Holidays
In lieu of additional compensation with regard to the other holidays recognized in Section 23.01,

Page 49 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

commencing with the 2011 payroll year, and continuing thereafter, on the first day of the payroll year
each employee shall be credited with a holiday time bank consisting of the number of hours of two (2)
regular work days. The employee’s “regular work day” shall be determined based on the employee’s
assignment as of the first day of the payroll year. Requests for holiday time off shall be considered by
supervisors on the same basis as vacation requests. Holiday time does not carry over from year to year
and, therefore; holiday time banks will revert to zero as of 11:59 p.m. on the last day of each payroll
year. Accrued but unused holiday time off at the time of an employee’s separation from service shall be
forfeited and, therefore, no compensation shall be payable for such accrued time.

ARTICLE 24
LEAVES OF ABSENCE WITH PAY

Section 24.01 - Leaves of Absence With Pay
Leaves of absence with pay may be granted to permanent employees under the provisions of this article

when approved in advance by the Employer prior to the commencement of the leave.

Section 24.02 - Bereavement Leave

A leave of absence with pay of three (3) working days shall be granted in the event a permanent
employee suffers a death in his/her immediate family. Immediate family is defined as an employee's
Parent, Stepparent, Spouse, Registered Domestic Partner within the meaning of Minneapolis Code of
Ordinances, Chapter 142, Child, Stepchild, Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, Stepsister, Father-in-law,
Mother-in-law, Brother-in-law, Sister-in-law, Son-in-law, Daughter-in-law, Grandparent, Grandchild,
Great Grandparent, Great Grandchild, or dependents in the employee’s household. For purposes of this
subdivision, the terms father-in-law and mother-in-law shall be construed to include the father and
mother of an employee's domestic partner.

Bereavement Leave may be used intermittently. However, the three (3) working days must be used
within five (5) working days from the time of death or funeral, unless an extension is required for
individually demonstrated circumstance. Intermittent use must be approved by the employee’s
supervisor. Approval will not be reasonably withheld. In the even the supervisor does not approve, the
employee may immediately appeal to the next upper level of the hierarchy.

Additional time off without pay, or vacation, if available and requested in advance, shall be granted as
may reasonably be required under individually demonstrated circumstances. Accrued and available
leave balances (vacation, sick leave or compensatory time) may be used following current approval
practices.

Section 24.03 - Jury Duty and Court Witness Leave
After due notice to the Employer, employees subpoenaed to serve as a witness or called for jury duty,

shall be paid their regular compensation at their current base rate of pay for the period the court duty
requires their absence from work duty, plus any expenses paid by the court. Such employees, so
compensated, shall not be eligible to retain jury duty pay or witness fees and shall turn any such pay or
fees received over to the Employer. If an employee is excused from jury duty prior to the end of the
normal workday, he/she/she shall return to work if reasonably practicable or make arrangements for a
leave of absence without pay. For purposes of this Section, such employees shall be considered to be
working normal day shift hours for the duration of their jury duty leave. This Section shall not apply to:

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

a. Any absence arising from the employee's participation in litigation where such participation is
within the scope of the employment of such employee - such absences shall be compensated
pursuant to the terms of Section 20.03, Subd. 4 (Court, Court Standby, OPCR and Preparation)
of this Agreement; or

b. Any absence, whether voluntary or by legal order to appear or testify in private litigation, not in
the status of an employee but as a plaintiff or defendant - such absences shall be charged against
accumulated vacation, compensatory time or be without pay.

Section 24.04 - Military Leave With Pay

obligations.

 

Section 24.05 - Olympic Competition Leave

on the Olympic level, provided that the period of such paid leave will not exceed the period of the
official training camp and competition combined or ninety (90) calendar days per year, whichever is
less.

Section 24.06 - Bone Marrow Donor Leave

Pursuant to applicable Minnesota statutes, employees who work twenty (20) or more hours per week
shall, upon advance notification to their immediate supervisor and approval by the Employer, be granted
a paid leave of absence at the time they undergo medical procedures to donate bone marrow. At the
time such employees request the leave, they shall provide to their immediate supervisor written
verification by a physician of the purpose and length of the required leave. The combined length of
leaves for this purpose may not exceed forty (40) hours unless agreed to by the Employer in its sole
discretion.

Section 24.07 - Injury on Duty
The Chief of Police, with approval of the Civil Service Commission if necessary, shall grant an

employee Injury On Duty (IOD) leave of absence with pay for a physical disability incurred in the
performance of law enforcement duty for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) calendar days in
accordance with the length of the disability. Disability incurred in the performance of duties peculiar to
law enforcement will apply only to leave necessitated as the direct and approximate result of an actual
injury or illness whether or not considered compensable under the Minnesota Workers' Compensation
law. Disability resulting from each new injury or illness incurred in the performance of law
enforcement duty, or a recurrent disability resulting directly from a previous injury or illness sustained
in the performance of law enforcement duty, will be compensable pursuant to, and where otherwise not
in conflict with, the provisions of this Section. Such leave will not apply to disabilities incurred as the
direct result of substantial and wanton negligence or misconduct of the disabled employee. The
following conditions shall apply to IOD leave:

(a) When employees exhaust the one hundred eighty (180) days as provided in this section
but remain disabled, they will be required to then expend their regular earned sick leave
and vacation leave in order to obtain compensation during the period of continuing leave

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

of absence resulting from the disability. When the employee has exhausted his/her sick
leave and vacation and still is disabled, the Employer may grant the employee additional
disability leave in an amount up to ninety (90) working days. To be eligible for such
additional IOD leave, the City's health care provider must certify that the employee will
be able to return to the full performance of his/her duties at the expiration of such
extended leave.

(b) When an employee returns to work following his/her use of earned sick leave or vacation
or during the period which they are on extended leave as provided above, regular earned

sick leave will be restored to the employee as follows:

employee, at the expiration of such leave, shall be restored to his/her position.

ARTICLE 25
LEAVES OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY

Section 25.01 - Leaves of Absence Without Pay
Leaves of absence without pay may be granted to permanent employees when authorized by Minnesota

statute or by the Employer pursuant to the provisions of this Article upon written application to the
employee's immediate supervisor or his/her designated representative. Except for emergency situations,
leaves must be approved in writing by the Employer prior to commencement.

Section 25.02 - Leaves of Absence Governed by Statute
The following leaves of absence without pay may be granted as authorized by applicable Minnesota
statutes:

 

(a) Military Leave. Employees shall be entitled to military leaves of absence without pay for
duty in the regular Armed Forces of the United States, the National Guard or the
Reserves. At the expiration of such leaves, such employees shall be entitled to their
position or a comparable position and shall receive other benefits in accordance with
applicable Minnesota statutes. (See also, Military Leave With Pay at Section 24.04 of
this Agreement.)

Page 52 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

(b) Appointive and Elective Office Leave. Leaves of absence without pay to serve in an
unclassified or appointed City position or as a Minnesota State Legislator or full-time
elective officer in a city or county of Minnesota shall be granted pursuant to applicable
Minnesota statutes. A vacancy created by a leave to allow an employee to serve in an
appointed position or an elected position, other than in the Minnesota Legislature, shall
be deemed a “permanent vacancy” meaning that the vacancy may not be filled by a
detail. A vacancy created by a leave to allow an employee to serve in an elected office in
the Minnesota Legislature shall be deemed a “temporary vacancy,” meaning that that the
vacancy may be filled by a detail under Section 16.04, so long as the legislative office is
deemed “part-time.” If an employee returns from such a leave, he/she shall have the right
to return to his/her last-held civil service rank. The return of such person shall not result
in the removal (bumping) of another person in such rank, except when the person is
returning to the rank of Captain. To the extent such return from a leave of absence under
this Section causes there to be an excess above the authorized strength at the rank of
Police Officer, Sergeant or Lieutenant, the excess shall be reduced through attrition.

(c) School Conference and Activities Leave. Leaves of absence without pay of up to a total
of sixteen (16) hours during a school year for the purpose of attending school conferences
and classroom activities of the employee's child, provided that such conferences and
classroom activities cannot be scheduled during non-work hours. When the need for the
leave is foreseeable, the employee shall provide reasonable prior notice of the leave to
their immediate supervisor and shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as
not to disrupt the operations of the Employer. Employees may use accumulated vacation
benefits or accumulated compensatory time for the duration of such leaves.

(d) Family and Medical Leaves

(1) General. Pursuant to the provisions of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
of 1993, as amended, and the regulations promulgated there under (which shall
govern employee rights and obligations as to family and medical leaves wherever
they may conflict with the provisions of this paragraph), leaves of absence of up
to twelve (12) weeks in any twelve (12) months will be granted to eligible
employees who request them for the following reasons:

 

(A) _ for purposes associated with the birth or adoption of a child or the
placement of a child with the employee for foster care,

(B) _ when they are unable to perform the functions of their positions because of
temporary sickness or disability,

(C) — when they must care for their parent, spouse, registered domestic partner
within the meaning of Minneapolis Code of Ordinances Chapter 142,
child, or other dependents and/or members of their households who have a
serious medical condition, and/or

(D) military family leave meeting the requirements of a “qualifying exigency
leave” or “military caregiver leave.”

Page 53 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

Unless an employee elects to use accumulated paid leave benefits while on family and
medical leaves (see subparagraph (6), below), such leaves are without pay. The
Employee's group health, dental and life insurance benefits shall, however, be continued
on the same basis as if the employee had not taken the leave.

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

Eligibility. Employees are eligible for family and medical leaves if they have
accumulated at least twelve (12) months employment service preceding the
request for the leave and they must have worked at least one thousand forty-four
(1,044) hours during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the
leave. Eligible spouses or registered domestic partners who both work for the
Employer will be granted a combined twelve (12) weeks of leave in any twelve
(12) months when such leaves are for the purposes referenced in clauses (a) and
(c) above.

Notice Required. Employees must give thirty (30) calendar days’ notice of the
need for the leave if the need is foreseeable. If the need for the leave is not
foreseeable, notice must be given as soon as it is practicable to do so. Employees
must confirm their verbal notices for family and medical leaves in writing.
Notification requirements may be waived by the Employer for good cause shown.

Intermittent Leave. If medically necessary due to the serious medical condition of
the employee, or that of the employee's spouse, child, parent, registered domestic
partner within the meaning of Minneapolis Code of Ordinances Chapter 142, or
other dependents and/or members of their households who have a serious medical
condition, leave may be taken on an intermittent schedule. In cases of the birth,
adoption or foster placement of a child, family and medical leave may be taken
intermittently only when expressly approved by the Employer.

Medical Certification. The Employer may require certification from an attending
health care provider on a form it provides. The Employer may also request
second medical opinions provided it pays the full cost required.

Relationship Between Leave and Accrued Paid Leave. Employees may use
accrued vacation, sick leave or compensatory time while on leave. The use of
such paid leave benefits will not affect the maximum allowable duration of leaves
under this subdivision.

 

Reinstatement. Upon the expiration of family and medical leaves, employees will
be returned to an equivalent position within their former job classification.
Additional leaves of absence without pay described elsewhere in this Agreement
may be granted by the Employer within its reasonable discretion, but
reinstatement after any additional leave of absence without pay which may have
been granted by the Employer in conjunction with family and medical leaves, is
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 25.03 (Leaves of Absence Governed
by this Agreement) of the Agreement.

Leaves

Section 25.03 - Leaves of Absence Governed by this Agreement
Employees may be granted leaves of absence for the purpose set forth in this Section provided that such

leaves are consistent with the provisions of this Section. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
25.03: a leave of absence granted may not be renewed or extended without the expressed mutual
consent of the Parties; an employee on leave in excess of six (6) months will, at the expiration of the
leave, be placed on an appropriate layoff list for his/her classification if no vacancies exist in such
classification; and an employee on leave of less than six (6) months will, at the expiration of the leave,
return to a position within his/her classification.

(a)

(b)

Temporary illness or injury. A leave of absence for illness or injury to the employee or to
provide care for a member of the employee’s immediate family may be granted for up to
12 months. The employer may require that the condition be properly verified by medical
authority. Upon the expiration of the leave, the employee will return to a position,
determined at the discretion of the Chief, within his/her job classification. If the
employee is physically unable to return to work upon the expiration of the leave, he/she
will be placed on a medical layoff upon exhausting all accrued leave banks (vacation,
sick leave, compensatory time). An employee may remain on the medical layoff/recall
list for up to three (3) years.

If an employee is able to return to work upon the determination that he/she is fit for duty
prior to the expiration of the layoff, he/she shall have the right to return to a vacancy in
his/her last-held civil service rank. If there is no vacancy, the employee shall be entitled
to a vacancy in the highest rank below his/her last-held civil service rank where there is a
vacancy and shall be considered “on layoff’ from his/her last-held civil service rank,
subject to recall to the next available vacancy in that rank.

The vacancy created by a leave of absence for temporary illness or injury shall be
considered a “temporary vacancy,” meaning that the vacancy may be filled by a detail
under Section 16.04 for up to twelve (12) months. The vacancy shall be deemed
“permanent,” thus requiring the termination of a detail, if the employee is unable to return
to work upon the expiration of the leave or, prior to the expiration of the leave, the
employee separates from service.

Education. A leave of absence may be granted to allow an employee to pursue an
educational opportunity that benefits the employee to seek advancement opportunities
within the City or carry out job-related duties more effectively. The leave may be
granted for a period of up to 12 months and may, at the discretion of the Chief, be
renewed one time for up to an additional 12 months. A vacancy created by an initial
education leave of twelve (12) months or less shall be deemed a “temporary vacancy”
meaning that the vacancy may be filled by a detail under Section 16.04. A vacancy
created by an initial education leave of more than twelve (12) months or any renewal of
an initial education leave shall be deemed a “permanent vacancy” meaning that the
vacancy may not be filled by a detail. If an employee returns from such a leave, he/she
shall have the right to return to a vacancy in his/her last-held civil service rank. If there is
no vacancy, the employee shall be entitled to a vacancy in the highest rank below his/her
last-held civil service rank where there is a vacancy and shall be considered “on layoff’

from his/her last-held civil service rank, subject to recall to the next available vacancy in
that rank.

(c) Other Employment. A leave of absence of up to six (6) months may be granted to allow
an employee to serve in a position with another employer where such employment is
deemed by the Employer to be in the best interests of the City and will be deemed a
“temporary vacancy” meaning that the vacancy may be filled by a detail under Section
16.04. If the employee does not return to work immediately following the expiration of
such leave, the vacancy created by the employee’s decision to pursue other employment
shall become a “permanent vacancy” meaning that any detail that had been used to fill
the vacancy must terminate and the resulting vacancy may no longer be filled by a detail.
If an employee returns from such a leave, he/she shall have the right to return to a
vacancy in his/her last-held civil service rank. If there is no vacancy, the employee shall
be entitled to a vacancy in the highest rank below his/her last-held civil service rank
where there is a vacancy and shall be considered “on layoff” from his/her last-held civil
service rank, subject to recall to the next available vacancy in that rank.

(d) Candidate for Public Office. A leave of absence of up to 12 months may be granted to
allow an employee to become a candidate in an election for public office. A leave of
absence without pay commencing thirty calendar days prior to the election is required,
unless exempted by the Employer. A vacancy created by such a leave of six (6) months
or less shall be deemed a “temporary vacancy” meaning that the vacancy may be filled by
a detail under Section 16.04. A vacancy created by such a leave of more than six (6)
months shall be deemed a “permanent vacancy” meaning that the vacancy may not be
filled by a detail. If an employee returns from such a leave, he/she shall have the right to
return to a vacancy in his/her last-held civil service rank. If there is no vacancy, the
employee shall be entitled to a vacancy in the highest rank below his/her last-held civil
service rank where there is a vacancy and shall be considered “on layoff’ from his/her
last-held civil service rank, subject to recall to the next available vacancy in that rank.

(e) Personal Convenience. A leave of absence of up to six (6) months may be granted for
the personal convenience of the requesting employee. A vacancy created by such a leave
shall be deemed a “temporary vacancy” meaning that the vacancy may be filled by a
detail under Section 16.04. If the employee does not return to work immediately
following the expiration of such leave, the vacancy created by the employee’s absence
shall become a “permanent vacancy” meaning that any detail that had been used to fill
the vacancy must terminate and the resulting vacancy may no longer be filled by a detail.
If an employee returns from such a leave, he/she shall have the right to return to a
vacancy in his/her last-held civil service rank. If there is no vacancy, the employee shall
be entitled to a vacancy in the highest rank below his/her last-held civil service rank
where there is a vacancy and shall be considered “on layoff” from his/her last-held civil
service rank, subject to recall to the next available vacancy in that rank.

(f) Additional Parenting Leave. A leave of absence of up to twelve (12) consecutive weeks
may to granted to an employee who has exhausted his/her FMLA leave resulting from the
birth or adoption of a child and who requests additional parenting leave. A vacancy

may be filled by a detail under Section 16.04. During an additional parenting leave, an
employee shall continue to accrue seniority and shall be entitled to work off-duty jobs in
uniform under the same terms and conditions that apply to active employees. If both
parents of the child work for the City of Minneapolis: the additional parenting leave of
up to twelve (12) weeks shall be split between the parents (to the extent that both parents
request the additional leave); and the Employer shall continue to pay the Employer
portion of the health insurance premium, HRA/VEBA contribution and dental insurance
premium for an employee who has elected such coverages while such employee is on the
additional parenting leave.

(g) Holiday Donation for Federation Business. Employees shall be relieved from their
regularly scheduled duties to engage in Federation activities in accordance with the terms
of this Section.

(1) Federation Personnel — Full Time. The Federation President and/or any personnel
he/she/ may designate to work exclusively on Federation business on a permanent
basis (the "Full-Time Personnel") will be assigned to the Human Resources Unit
of the Administrative Services Division and shall continue as employees of the
Department with all rights, benefits and obligations relating thereto.

(2) Federation Personnel — Temporary. Members of the Federation Board of
Directors or other Federation members (the "Temporary Personnel") shall, from
time to time, be relieved from performing their regularly assigned work duties to
allow them to engage in Federation business.

(3) Notice of Designation to Perform Federation Business. In order to minimize the
disruption to the Department which may be caused by the absence of an employee
on leave to conduct Federation business, the Federation shall provide advance
written notice to the Department as follows:

i. if the employee will be working exclusively on Federation business for more
than six consecutive months (the “Full-Time Personnel”), such notice shall be
given as soon as practical but in no event less than sixty days prior to the
commencement of the assignment to the Federation;

ii. if the employee will be working exclusively on Federation business for more
than one but less than six consecutive months, such notice shall be given as
soon as practical but in no event less than thirty days prior to the
commencement of the assignment to the Federation;

iii. if the employee will be working on Federation business for all or part of less
than thirty-one consecutive days, such notice shall be given as soon as
practical but in no event less than fifteen days prior to the posting of the

Leaves

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the employee is seeking a leave from his/her
regular work duties to work on Federation business of a nature for which neither
the Federation nor the employee could sufficiently plan in advance, the Federation
shall give such notice as soon as is practical.

(4) The parties agree that the Department retains the right to limit an unplanned leave
for Temporary Personnel to three consecutive workdays. For the purpose of the
foregoing limitation, “work days” are days on which the affected employee was
scheduled to work at his/her regular assignment. The Federation agrees that it will
not seek a leave of absence of more than thirty-one consecutive days for
Temporary Personnel to work exclusively on Federation business during the
months of June, July and August. These limitations shall not apply to the Full-
Time Personnel.

(5) The Federation shall have the right and responsibility to direct the activities of
personnel while such personnel are engaged in Federation business pursuant to
this paragraph. To preserve the right of the Federation to assign the duties of the
Full-Time Personnel, the Department shall not order Full-Time Personnel to
perform duties for the Police Department, except for: training required for such
Full-Time Personnel to retain their POST license and/or good standing as
employees of the Minneapolis Police Department; being interviewed under
Garrity by Internal Affairs; or required participation in criminal or civil litigation
relating to duties performed by the employee as a Minneapolis Police officer
(collectively the “Mandatory MPD Duties”).

The Department may request Full-Time Personnel to perform duties for the
Department other than the Mandatory MPD Duties. The Full-Time Personnel
may accept or decline such requested duties. If accepted, such duties shall be
compensated at the “overtime” rate unless the parties enter into a prior written
agreement that provides for compensation at the “‘straight-time” rate.

Full-Time Personnel may volunteer for overtime opportunities in the Department
(such as Buyback, MOU shifts, etc.) on the same basis as other MPD personnel
and shall be paid at the overtime rate for such work. Full-Time Personnel may
also work off-duty jobs, subject to the terms of the MPD Policy and Procedure
Manual. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection:

i. Except with regard to Buyback and MOU Shifts which are always
compensated at the overtime rate just as they are for all other employees, Full-
Time Personnel shall not be compensated at the overtime rate for any work for
the Department unless they are in paid status (time spent on any combination
of Federation business, MPD duties and use of accrued time off banks, with
the exception of compensatory time) for at least 80 hours during the same pay
period in which the Department work is performed; and

ii. the first eight (8) consecutive hours per shift of time engaged in Mandatory
MPD duties shall always be compensated at the straight time rate and

Page 58 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

consecutive time in excess of eight (8) hours shall be compensated at the
overtime rate.

(6) Donated Time Account. The Employer will donate time to the Federation’s
Donated Time Account for each member of the Federation as of the first day of
the first payroll period of each year. The payroll section of the Minneapolis
Police Department shall maintain an up-to-date and accurate system of accounting
for the accumulation and use of donated time. The payroll section shall contact
the Federation office at least once per month to advise the Federation of the
balance in this account. Any discrepancies in accounting will be corrected
promptly. Up to four hundred (400) hours of unused donated time may be carried
over to the next payroll year. Each payroll period, the Federation will contact the
Payroll Clerk in the Human Resources Unit to report the hours worked during the
payroll period by the full-time and temporary Federation personnel. The number
of hours absent from duty and which are spent on Federation business will be
debited from the donated time account. Time relating to the following shall be
compensated by the City and shall not be debited from the donated time account:
work performed for the Department, including the Mandatory MPD Duties by
Full-Time Personnel, voluntary work performed by Full-Time Personnel and the
regular assigned duties of Temporary Personnel; and use of vacation days, sick
days, and compensatory time. The parties acknowledge that the start time and/or
end time entered into the payroll system may or may not reflect the start or end
time of Federation Hours actually worked.

 

Nothing herein shall preclude the Federation from compensating members for the
performance of Federation business under certain circumstances, determined in
the sole discretion of the Federation, by directing the application of hours from
the Federation’s Donated Time Account on more than an “hour for hour” basis
provided such compensation bears a reasonable relationship to hours actually
worked on Federation Business. The rate of compensation payable with regard to
hours debited from the Federation’s Donated Time Account shall be the regular
hourly “straight-time” rate of the individual employee for such hours as
established pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(h) Special Rule for Police Officers. An employee in the rank of Police Officer who is
eligible to return to work following a leave of absence granted under this Section 25.03,
shall have the right to return to work as a Police Officer regardless of whether a vacancy
exists at the time he/she is ready to return to work, except when there is no vacancy due
to a reduction in the number of budgeted “full time employees” in the rank of Police
Officer that occurred while the employee was on a leave of absence. In that event, the
employee may, at the time he/she is eligible to return to work, displace an employee in
the rank of Police Officer with lesser seniority and the employee with the least seniority
may be laid off subject to the provisions of Article 21.

(i) Consecutive Leaves of Absence Prohibited. Unless the Parties mutually agree, an
employee who is granted a leave of absence for one of the circumstances described in
subparagraphs (b) through (e) of this Section 25.03 must return to work and remain in

Page 59 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

paid status for at least six (6) months before he/she may be granted another leave of
absence for one of the circumstances described in subparagraphs (b) through (e) of this
Section.

Section 25.04 - Budgetary Leaves of Absence.

Budgetary leaves of absence may be granted to employees when, in the Employer's sole discretion, it is
necessary to reduce its operating budget. Such leaves shall be without pay, however, seniority, vacation,
sick leave, and insurance benefits shall not be interrupted or lost on account of the leave. Budget leaves
may not be: 1) imposed involuntarily on employees or 2) approved for any other purpose. At the
expiration of a budgetary leave, the employee shall return to his/her department in a position within

his/her classification.

a. Continuous Leave. An employee may request a leave of absence for a continuous period
of not less than four weeks and not more than 12 months. Such leave shall be taken in
increments of not less than one week. To be eligible for the leave, the employee must
notify the Employer in writing on or before November | of the year prior to the calendar
year in which the leave is to occur. Such written notice shall include the requested
starting and ending date of the leave. Once granted by the Employer, the employee must
take such leave during the period requested and may not return to work unless the
Employer, in its sole discretion agrees.

b. Intermittent Leave. An employee who has not taken or committed to a continuous
budgetary leave during any calendar year, may request an intermittent unpaid leave of
absence for up to 90 days during any calendar year. Such leave may be taken
intermittently in increments of not less than one day and not more than 90 days.

(1)

(2)

With Binding Commitment. Intermittent budgetary leave shall be granted (subject
to the business needs of the Department) if requested by the employee in writing
on or before November 1“ for leave to be taken in the following payroll year. The
written request must specify the number of days of unpaid leave to be taken by
the employee. Once the request is received by the Employer, the employee must
take unpaid leave in the amount requested, unless the Employer in its sole
discretion, agrees. To take the time off, the employee shall notify the Employer at
least 30 days before the beginning of the 28-day scheduling period of the days
he/she wants off during that scheduling period. Requests for leave made on less
than 30 days’ notice may be granted or denied by the Employer on the same terms
as a request for vacation, however, the Employer shall use its best efforts to
accommodate the requests of the Employee. If the Employee has not exhausted
his/her leave or designated the days on which he/she will be off on or before
September 1, the Employer may schedule the time off at its discretion, but shall
attempt to do on days mutually agreeable to the employee.

 

  

Without Binding Commitment. Intermittent budgetary leave may be granted if
requested by the employee after the deadlines set forth in subsection (1), above.
Notwithstanding such request, the employee is not obligated to take such leave.
However, the Employer is also not obligated to grant the request. Requests for
unpaid intermittent leave without a binding commitment shall be subordinate to

Page 60 of 95

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

requests for vacation and compensatory time off. The employee shall attempt to
give the Employer as much advance notice as is reasonably practical.

c. During such budgetary leave of absence, an employee shall continue to accrue vacation,
sick leave and seniority and the Employer shall continue to pay the Employer’s portion of
any health, dental or life insurance premiums in effect with regard to such employee
immediately prior to the commencement of such leave. Similarly, the employee shall
continue to pay any monthly employee portions in order to maintain benefit levels.

d. During an intermittent budgetary leave, an employee shall be entitled to work off-duty
jobs in uniform under the same terms and conditions that apply to active employees.

Section 25.05 - Background Check for Employees Returning to Work After Extended Absence
Prior to reinstating to active duty status an employee who is reinstated pursuant to Section 16.06 or is

returning from a leave of absence, layoff or disciplinary action that lasted six months or more, the
Employer shall conduct a background check on the employee. In determining whether the employee has
passed the background check, the Employer shall use the same standards as are used to determine
whether to disqualify a new hire. The employee shall cooperate by providing to the background
investigator(s) such information as is reasonably related to evaluating the employee’s fitness for duty.
The Employer shall complete the background check as soon as is possible after the employee has
provided written verification that the reason for his/her absence has expired or terminated and that
he/she/she is available to report for duty. Except in cases of reinstatement pursuant to Section 16.06, if
the background check is not completed within 14 days after the employee has provided such written
verification of availability, the Employer shall place the employee in paid status (even if the employee is
not cleared to return to active duty) effective as of the 1s” day after such notice is received; unless the
Employer was unable to complete the background check solely because of the employee’s failure to
cooperate with the investigator(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, where reinstatement occurs as a
result of a grievance or other appeal of disciplinary action, the employee shall be returned to paid status
as of the effective date of such award or order. Upon determining that the employee has pass
background check, the Employer shall reinstate the employee to active duty status.

Leaves

Subd. 3. Traumatic Incident

An officer who participates in or observes an incident which may have a lasting psychological
impact on an officer, as determined by his/her supervisor, may request to be placed on administrative
leave. Administrative leave of up to one full work day may be granted by the employee’s immediate
supervisor. A leave of up to three (3) full work days may be granted by the employee’s division or
precinct commander.

Subd. 4. Pending Investigation of Allegations of Misconduct

The Chief or his/her designee, at his/her sole discretion, may place an employee on a paid
administrative leave of absence or limited duty status pending the investigation of allegations of severe
misconduct. The Chief shall speak with a representative of the Federation regarding the basis for the
decision, if practical, prior to placing an employee on administrative leave but in no event more than
three (3) days after the placement of an employee on administrative leave or limited duty status. With
regard to allegations that are under investigation by or at the direction of the MPD, the Chief shall cause
the allegations to be investigated as promptly as possible without compromising the thoroughness and
impartiality of the investigation. Once the investigation is concluded, the Chief will promptly make a
decision as to whether discipline is to be imposed, and if so the level of discipline, and notify the
employee.

 

Subd. 5. Work Day Defined for Leave Resulting From a Critical Incident

Each day of the initial period of administrative leave (up to seven days for an Involved Officer
(Critical Incident); and up to three days for a Witness Officer (Critical Incident) or an officer
experiencing a Traumatic Incident) shall be considered a fully paid regularly scheduled “work day.”
The officer’s schedule may be adjusted in order to avoid, to the extent possible, the administrative leave
from creating an overtime obligation for excess hours in a payroll period. If the leave is extended
beyond seven days (three days for a Witness Officer or an officer experiencing a Traumatic Incident),
the period of the additional paid leave shall be scheduled such that the officer receives his/her regular
pay, but no overtime pay.

 

Section 26.02 - Duration of Leave.

Subd. 1. Critical Incident

The duration of administrative leave for an Involved Officer shall be not less than three calendar
days. The leave may extend to a maximum of seven calendar days following the critical incident at the
discretion of the Chief. The leave may be extended beyond seven days if requested by the Involved
Officer and approved by the Chief. The duration of administrative leave for a Witness Officer shall not
exceed three calendar days. The leave may be extended beyond three days if requested by the Witness
Officer and approved by the Chief. The foregoing limitations on the maximum duration of
administrative leave shall not apply when:

1. the officer is unfit for duty as determined pursuant to Article 31; or

2. there is sufficient reliable evidence to support a preliminary conclusion that the officer may
have engaged in conduct relating to the incident which, if true, would constitute a terminable
offense. In such case, following the expiration of the seven calendar days, the administrative
leave shall be considered to be a leave pending investigation.

Leaves

Subd. 2. Pending Investigation
The duration of the administrative leave leave or limited duty status, and any restrictions on the

ability of the employee to work off-duty or overtime relating thereto, shall be at the discretion of the
Chief for the first thirty (30) days. Thereafter, the duration of the administrative leave or limited duty
status and any restrictions relating thereto shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. After the
initial 30-day period, the Federation may request (not more frequently than once every two weeks) that
the Chief provide an update on the status of the investigation and/or review the duty status and the
restrictions on the employee. After the initial 30-day period, the duration of the administrative leave or
limited duty status shall depend on whether there is sufficient reliable evidence to support a preliminary
conclusion that an allegation of severe misconduct may be sustained. If there is such evidence, the
administrative leave or limited duty status shall continue at the discretion of the Chief. If there is not
such evidence, the administrative leave or limited duty status shall end and the employee shall return to
work in accordance with the provisions of Section 26.04, Subd. 2. If, after the initial 30 days, the parties
do not agree as to whether the allegation is of severe misconduct or whether there is sufficient reliable
evidence to support a preliminary conclusion that the allegation may be sustained; the Federation may
request that the dispute be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process set forth in the
Memorandum of Agreement attached hereto as Attachment G.

the applicable statute. If an employee is required to reimburse the Employer for the compensation
payments thus received, by reason of the employee's settlement with a third party, his/her sick leave,
vacation or compensatory time will be reinstated for the number of days which the reimbursement
equals in terms of salary. In calculating the number of days, periods of one-half (2) day or more shall
be considered as one (1) day and periods of less than one-half (¥2) day shall be disregarded.

ARTICLE 28
SICK LEAVE CREDIT PAY AND SEVERANCE PAY

Section 28.01 - Sick Leave Credit Pay Plan
An employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of this Section, shall be entitled to make an

election to receive payment for sick leave accrued but unused under the terms and conditions set forth
below.

(a) Eligibility. An employee who has an accumulation of sick leave of four
hundred eighty (480) hours or more on December | of each year (hereafter an
“Eligible Employee”) shall be eligible to make the election described below.

(b) Election. On or before December 10 of each year, the Employer shall provide
to each Eligible Employee a written election form on which the Eligible
Employee may elect: whether he/she wants to receive cash payment for all or
any portion of his/her sick leave that is accrued but is unused during the
calendar year immediately following the election (the “Accrual Year”); and, if
payment is to be made, the method of payment (regular or optional) as
described below. The employee shall deliver the election form to the
Employer on or before December 31. Such election is irrevocable. Therefore,
once an Eligible Employee transmits his/her election form to the Employer,
the employee may not revoke the decision to receive cash payment for sick
leave or change the method of payment or the amount of sick leave for which
payment is to be made. If an Eligible Employee does not transmit an election
form to the employer on or before December 31, he/she shall be considered to
have directed the Employer to NOT make a cash payment for sick leave
accrued during the Accrual Year. If an Eligible Employee elects to receive
payment, but does not specifically elect the optional method, the optional
method shall NOT be used.

based on fifty percent (50%) of the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay
in effect on December 31 of the Accrual Year.

ii. At Least Seven Hundred Twenty (720) Hours, But Less Than Nine
Hundred Sixty (960) Hours. With regard to an Eligible Employee who, as
of December 31 of the Accrual Year, has accumulated at least seven

accrued during the Accrual Year at the rate specified in subparagraph

Page 69 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Leaves

ii. or iii., above.

The amount of the payment under the Optional Method shall be based
on the percentage of the employee’s regular hourly rate that would
apply to all of the hours for which the employee is to be paid (namely,
the next lower rate than that for which the employee was otherwise
qualified).

(d) Adjustment of Sick Leave Bank. The number of hours for which payment is
made shall be deducted from the Eligible Employee’s sick leave bank at the

The employee may satisfy the aerobic power component by satisfactorily performing either a
GXT Test or 1.5 mile run. The employee at his/her sole discretion may select either the GXT Test or the

1.5 mile run. If the employee selects the GXT Test, he/she/she must agree in writing that the test
administrator may disclose a numerical test score to the MPD. If an employee selects to do the run,
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

he/she still is entitled to take one GXT Test per year for his/her own personal benefit and the results of
such GXT Test need not be disclosed to the MPD.

The employee may satisfy the upper body strength component by attaining the standards for
either the flat weight or percentage of body weight as measured by the bench press or performing the
requisite number of push-ups. The employee may satisfy the lower body strength component by
attaining the standards for either the flat weight as measured by the leg press or performing the required
vertical jump. The employee must select either the bench press or push-ups and the leg press or vertical
jump prior to taking the test.

Subd. 4. Fitness Goals

The fitness goals have been determined and validated as appropriate job-related measures by a
consultant with recognized expertise in establishing fitness standards for law enforcement officers. The
fitness goals for each component of the test shall be the same as the requirements for successful
completion of the academy, but shall not be more stringent than the following:

option, may retest at any time the test is given by the Department during the year. However, an
employee may not retest on more than two components within less than 60 days of a prior attempt. An
employee who elects to retest and who has attained the Goal on at least three of the Components within
90 days of the retest shall be considered to have attained each of the Goals by retesting only those
Components for which he/she did not initially meet the Goal. An employee who elects to retest and who

condition is refused by his/her commander, the commander shall refer the
employee to the City’s health care professional who shall make the determination
as to whether the employee is able to take the test.

(5) The City’s health care professional may excuse the employee from testing if the
professional determines that the employee is suffering from a condition which
prevents the employee from performing the test safely or to the best of his/her
ability. The employee shall be tested as soon as is practical after the City’s health
care professional has certified that the employee is able to perform the Test safely
and to the best of his/her ability. When evaluating an employee’s ability to take

Facility") and an annual voluntary GXT Test or other preventative medical test mutually agreed upon by
the parties (the “Annual Test”).

Subd. 2. GXT Test

ARTICLE 30
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING

Section 30.01 - Purpose Statement
Abuse of drugs and alcohol is a nationwide problem. It affects persons of every age, race, sex and

ethnic group. It poses risks to the health and safety of employees of the City of Minneapolis and to the
public. To reduce those risks, the City and the Federation, by collective bargaining, adopted this
Agreement concerning drugs and alcohol in the workplace. This Agreement establishes standards
concerning drugs and alcohol which all employees must meet and it establishes a testing procedure to
ensure that those standards are met.

This drug and alcohol testing Article is intended to conform to the provisions of the Minnesota Drug
and Alcohol Testing in the Workplace Act (Minnesota Statutes §181.950 to 181.957), as well as the
requirements of the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D)
and related federal regulations. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as a limitation upon the
Employer's obligation to comply with federal law and regulations regarding drug and alcohol testing.

Section 30.02 - Work Rules

(a) | No employee shall be under the influence of any drug or alcohol while the employee is
working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the
Employer's vehicle, machinery, or equipment, except pursuant to a valid medical reason
or when approved by the Employer as a proper law enforcement activity.

(b) No employee shall use, possess, sell or transfer drugs, alcohol or drug paraphernalia
while the employee is working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or
operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment, except pursuant to a valid
medical reason, as determined by the Medical Review Officer, or when approved by the
Employer as a proper law enforcement activity.

(c) No employee, while on duty, shall engage or attempt to engage or conspire to engage in
conduct which would violate any law or ordinance concerning drugs or alcohol,
regardless of whether a criminal conviction results from the conduct.

(d) As a condition of employment, no employee shall engage in the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the Employer's
workplace.

Page 77 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
(e)

(f)

(g)

Fitness and Wellness for Duty

As a condition of employment, every employee must notify the Employer of any criminal
drug statute conviction no later than five (5) days after such conviction.

Any employee who receives a criminal drug statute conviction, if not discharged from
employment, must within thirty (30) days satisfactorily participate in a drug abuse
assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a federal, state or
local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

The Employer shall notify the granting agency within ten (10) days after receiving notice
of a criminal drug statute conviction from an employee or otherwise receiving actual
notice of such conviction.

Section 30.03 - Person Subject To Testing

All employees are subject to testing under applicable sections of this Article. However, no person will
be tested for drugs or alcohol under this Article without the person's consent. The Employer will require
an individual to undergo drug or alcohol testing only under the circumstances described in this Article.

Section 30.04 - Circumstances For Drug Or Alcohol Testing

A. Reasonable Suspicion Testing. The Employer may, but does not have a legal duty to, request
or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the Employer or any supervisor of
the employee has a reasonable suspicion (a belief based on specific facts and rational inferences
draw from those facts) related to the performance of the job that the employee:

Is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while the employee is working or while the
employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery, or
equipment; or

Has used, possessed, sold or transferred drugs, alcohol or drug paraphernalia while the
employee was working or while the employee was on the Employer's premises or operating
the Employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment (other than in connection with the
employee’s official duties); or

Has sustained a personal injury as that term is defined in Minnesota Statutes §176.011, Subd.
16, or has caused another person to die or sustain a personal injury; or

Was operating or helping to operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work-
related accident resulting in property damage or personal injury and the Employer or
investigating supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that the cause of the accident may be
related to the use of drugs or alcohol; or

Has discharged a firearm loaded with bullets, slugs or shot other than: (1) on an established
target range; (2) while conducting authorized ballistics tests; (3) while engaged in
recreational hunting activities; or (4) when authorized by a supervisor to shoot a wounded or
dangerous animal or to disable a light, lock or other object which presents an impediment or
hazard to an officer who is carrying out his/her lawful duties.

Page 78 of 95

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

More than one Agent of the Employer shall be involved in determinations under subsections A.1.
and A.2. of this Section 30.04.

The mere request or requirement that an employee be tested pursuant to subparagraph 3, 4 or 5,
above, does not constitute an admission by the employer or the employee that the employee has
caused an accident or death or injury to another nor does it create or establish any legal liability
for the employer or the employee to another person or entity.

B. Treatment Program Testing. The employer may request or require an employee to submit to
drug and alcohol testing if the employee is referred for chemical dependency treatment by reason
of having a positive test result under this Article or is participating in a chemical dependency
treatment program under an employee benefit plan. In such case, the employee may be required
to submit to drug or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period
and for a period of up to two years following notification that he/she will be subjected to
Treatment Program Testing.

C. Unannounced Testing by Agreement. The employer may request or require an employee to
submit to drug and alcohol testing without prior notice on terms and conditions established by a
written “last-chance” agreement between the Employer and employee’s collective bargaining
representative.

D. Testing Pursuant to Federal Law. The employer may request or require an employee to
submit to testing as may be necessary to comply with federal law and regulations. It is the intent
of this Article that federal law preempts both state drug and alcohol testing laws and City
policies and agreements. If this Article conflicts with federal law or regulations, federal law and
regulations shall prevail. If there are conflicts between federal regulations and this Article,
attributed in part to revisions to the law or changes in interpretations, and when those changes
have not been updated or accurately reflected in this policy, the federal law shall prevail.

Section 30.05 - Refusal To Undergo Testing

A. Right to Refuse. Employees have the right to refuse to undergo drug and alcohol testing.
If an employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing requested or required by the
Employer, no such test shall be given.

B. Consequences of Refusal. If any employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing
requested or required by the Employer, the Employer may subject the employee to
disciplinary action up to and including discharge from employment.

Cc. Refusal on Religious Grounds. No employee who refuses to undergo drug or alcohol
testing of a blood sample upon religious grounds shall be deemed to have refused unless
the employee also refuses to undergo alternative drug or alcohol testing methods.

D. Failure to Provide a Valid Sample with a Certified Result. Failure to provide a Valid
Sample with a Certified Result shall constitute a refusal to undergo drug or alcohol
testing under this Section 30.05. A “failure to provide a Valid Sample with a Certified

Page 79 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

Result” means: 1) failing to provide a valid sample that can be used to detect the
presence of drugs and alcohol or their metabolites; 2) providing false information in
connection with a test; 3) attempting to falsify test results through tampering,
contamination, adulteration, or substitution; 4) failing to provide a specimen without a
legitimate medical explanation; or 5) demonstrating behavior which is obstructive,
uncooperative, or verbally offensive, and which results in the inability to conduct the test.

Section 30.06 - Procedure For Testing

A.

B.

Notification Form. Before requiring an employee to undergo drug or alcohol testing, the

individual has seen a copy of this Drug and Alcohol Testing Article, and (2) indicate
consent to undergo the drug and alcohol testing.

Collecting the Test Sample. The test sample shall be obtained in a private setting, and
the procedures for taking the sample shall ensure privacy to employees to the extent
practicable, consistent with preventing tampering with the sample. All test samples shall
be obtained by or under the direct supervision of a health care professional.

Testing the Sample. The handling and testing of the sample shall be conducted in the
manner specified in Minn. Stat. §181.953 by a testing laboratory which meets, and uses
methods of analysis which meet the criteria specified in Subds. 1, 3, and 5 of that statute.

Thresholds. The threshold of a sample to constitute a positive result alcohol, drugs, or
their metabolites is contained in the standards of one of the programs listed in MN Statute
§181.953, Subd.1. The employer shall, not less than annually, provide the Federation
with a list or access to a list of substances tested for under this Article and the threshold
limits for each substance. In addition, the employer shall notify the Federation of any
changes to the substances being tested for and of any changes to the thresholds at least
thirty (30) days prior to implementation.

Positive Test Results. In the event an employee tests positive for drug use, the employee
will be provided, in writing, notice of his/her right to explain the test results. The
employee may indicate any relevant circumstance, including over the counter or
prescription medication taken within the last thirty (30) days, or any other information
relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result.

treatment of chemical dependency to be chemically dependent and the Employer has first
given the employee an opportunity to participate in, at the employee's own expense or
pursuant to coverage under an employee benefit plan, either a drug or alcohol counseling
or rehabilitation program, whichever is more appropriate, as determined by the Employer

Section 30.08 - Action After Test

The Employer will not discharge, discipline, discriminate against, or request or require rehabilitation of
an employee solely on the basis of requesting that an employee submit to a test or on the existence of a
positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmatory test.

A. Positive Test Result. Where there has been a positive test result in a confirmatory test
and in any confirmatory retest (if the employee requested one), the Employer will do the
following unless the employee has furnished a legitimate medical reason for the positive
test result:

1.

First Offense - The employee will be referred for an evaluation by an LADC or a
physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency. If that
evaluation determines that the employee has a chemical dependency or abuse
problem, the Employer will give the employee an opportunity to participate in, at
the employee's own expense or pursuant to coverage under an employee benefit
plan, either a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program, whichever is
more appropriate, as determined by the Employer after consultation with and
LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical
dependency. If the employee either refuses to participate in the counseling or
rehabilitation program or fails to successfully complete the program, as evidenced
by withdrawal or discharge from the program before its completion, the Employer
may impose discipline, up to and including discharge.

Second Offense - Where an employee tests positive, and the employee has
previously participated in one program of treatment required by the Employer, the
Employer may impose discipline up to and including discharge of the employee
from employment. In determining the appropriate level of discipline for a second
offense, the Employer shall consider the employee’s employment history and the
length of time between the first and second offense.

B. Suspensions and Transfers.

1.

Pending Test Results From an Initial Screening Test or Confirmatory Test.
While awaiting the results from the Medical Review Officer, the employee shall
be allowed to return to work unless the Employer reasonably believes that
restrictions on the employee’s work status are necessary to protect the health or
safety of the employee, other City employees, or the public, and the conduct upon
which the employee became subject to drug and alcohol testing would,
independent of the of the results of the test, be grounds for discipline. In such
circumstances, the employer may temporarily suspend the tested employee with
pay, place the employee on paid investigatory leave or transfer the employee to
another position at the same rate of pay.

Pending Results of Confirmatory Retest. Confirmatory retests of the

original sample are at the employee’s own expense. When an employee

requests that a confirmatory retest be conducted, the employer may place the

employee on unpaid leave, place the employee on paid investigatory leave or
Page 82 of 95

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

transfer the employee to another position at the same rate of pay provided the
Employer reasonably believes that restrictions on the employee’s work status are
necessary to protect the health or safety of the employee, other City employees, or
the public. An employee placed on unpaid leave may use his/her accrued and
unused vacation or compensatory time during the time of leave. An employee
who has been placed on unpaid leave must be made whole if the outcome of the
confirmatory retest is negative.

3. Rights of Employee in Event of Work Restrictions. In situations where the
employee is not allowed to remain at work until the end of his/her normal work
day pursuant to this Paragraph B, the Employer may not prevent the employee
from removing his/her personal property, including but not limited to the
employee’s vehicle, from the Employer’s premises. If the employer reasonably
believes that upon early dismissal from work under this paragraph the employee is
about to commit a criminal offense by operating a motor vehicle while impaired
by drugs or alcohol, the Employer may advise the employee that law enforcement
action may be taken if the employee attempts to drive.

Cc. Other Misconduct. Nothing in this Article limits the right of the Employer to discipline
or discharge an employee on grounds other than a positive test result in a confirmatory
test, subject to the requirements of law, the rules of the Civil Service Commission, and
the terms of this collective bargaining agreement. For example, if evidence other than a
positive test result indicates that an employee engaged in the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the Employer's
workplace, the employee may receive a warning, a written reprimand, a suspension
without pay, a demotion, or a discharge from employment, depending upon the
circumstances, and subject to the above requirements.

 

D. Treatment Program Testing. The Employer may request or require an employee to
undergo drug and alcohol testing pursuant to the provisions of Section 30.04, Subd. 2.

Section 30.09 - Data Privacy
The purpose of collecting a body component sample is to test that sample for the presence of drugs or

alcohol or their metabolites. A sample provided for drug or alcohol testing will not be tested for any
other purpose. The name, initials and social security number of the person providing the sample are
requested so that the sample can be identified accurately but confidentially. Information about
medications and other information relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result
are requested to ensure that the test is reliable and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical
reason for any drug or alcohol in the sample. All data collected, including that in the notification form
and the test report, is intended for use in determining the suitability of the employee for employment.
The employee may refuse to supply the requested data; however, refusal to supply the requested data
may affect the person's employment status. The Employer will not disclose the test result reports and
other information acquired in the drug or alcohol testing process to another employer or to a third party
individual, governmental agency, or private organization without the written consent of the person
tested, unless permitted by law or court order.

ARTICLE 31
FITNESS FOR DUTY

Section 31.01 - Statement of Policy and Purpose

The Minneapolis Police Department and its employees know that the performance of law enforcement
duties is inherently demanding and that such duties are sometimes performed under dangerous
conditions and/or in a stressful environment. It is, therefore, important to the Department for the safety
of its employees and the public to ensure that all personnel in the service of the Department are
medically, psychologically and emotionally fit for duty. It shall be the policy of the Minneapolis Police
Department to require fitness for duty examinations in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.

 

It is the purpose of this Article is to establish standards and procedures for identifying and diagnosing
officers of the Department who may suffer from medical, psychological or emotional conditions which
impair their ability to perform their job duties satisfactorily. This Article shall be administered in a
manner which is consistent with the Department's desire to treat affected employees with dignity and
respect under such circumstances and to provide information and assistance to them concerning their
fitness for duty.

 

It is the goal of the City of Minneapolis to have healthy and productive employees and to facilitate
successful treatment for those employees experiencing debilitating health problems. In furtherance of
this goal, the Department is committed to applying this Article to promote rehabilitation, rather than
discipline, while minimizing the interruption to the employee's life and career and to the employer's
operations.

Section 31.02 - Circumstances Requiring Fitness For Duty Examinations
The Department may require an employee to be examined under this Article in the circumstances
described below:

 

(a) Where there exists a reasonable cause to believe, based upon specific observations and
facts and rational inferences drawn from those observations and facts, that an employee
may not be medically, psychologically or emotionally fit to perform the essential
functions of the position to which he or she is assigned without accommodation. Such
reasonable suspicion must be based upon: the observations of at least two supervisors or
co-workers who have first-hand knowledge; or upon reliable information provided to a
supervisor that the employee is currently exhibiting conduct which reasonably
demonstrates that the employee may be suffering from a physical or mental condition
which prevents the employee from effectively performing his/her duties. The decision to
require an employee to be examined will be made by a supervisor at or above the rank of
Inspector for precinct personnel, or at or above Commander for non-precinct personnel,
after due diligence to confirm the reliability of the information.

(b) Where an employee is returning to active service after a leave of absence without pay or
similar absence or where the employee has been outside of the Department's observation
or control for a period longer than six (6) calendar months.
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

(c) Where an employee is returning to active service after a serious illness, injury or medical
condition whether or not the employee's personal physician has placed restrictions on the
employee's job-related activities.

(d) Where an employee has been involved in a critical incident where the potential for
physical or psychological trauma to the employee was significant.

(e) Where the employee contends he/she is not medically, psychologically or emotionally fit
for duty.

The provisions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall not apply to psychological
evaluations. However, a Health Care Professional evaluating an employee’s physical fitness for
duty may recommend that an employee he/she has examined be referred for a psychological
evaluation, subject to the provisions of Section 31.04 below.

Nothing under this Article 31 shall establish a basis for Drug or Alcohol Testing. Drug and
Alcohol testing shall be governed solely by Article 30 of this Agreement and applicable law.
However, if the Health Care Professional evaluating the employee reasonably believes the
employee, due to alcohol or drug use, may pose a danger to him/herself or others, the Health
Care Professional will notify the Employer of such danger and indicate the symptoms or signs
the Employer should look for to minimize the danger. If the danger is considered immediate, the
Health Care Professional will summon a ranking member of the MPD administration.

 

Section 31.03 - Procedures Prior to Exam

Subd. 1. Step 1 - Documentation of Referral Notice and Information to Employee

When any one of the circumstances for examination exists and the related requirements have
been satisfied, as set forth in Section 31.02, the Chief shall provide written notice to the employee of the
referral for a fitness for duty evaluation. Such notice shall specify: which of the circumstances set forth
in Section 31.02 provide the basis for the referral; the name and contact information of the physician or
clinic to be conducting the exam; the reason why the doctor is being asked to evaluate and the suspected
impact upon the employee’s ability to effectively perform his/her duties (not required if the referral is
made under 31.02,(b)); and the date and time of the appointment. The notice shall be given in advance
of the appointment so that the employee has an opportunity to consult with the Federation and/or his/her
personal advisor. At the same time as such notice is given, the Employer shall along with the notice,
give the employee a copy of all information to be provided by the Department to the Health Care
Professional and a summary of all oral communication therewith, unless it is believed that the
information in the report is likely to cause harm to the employee or to others, in which case the
Federation will be informed of the decision.

  

Subd. 2. Step 2 - Employee’s Duty Status
At such time as the Department determines that an employee shall be required to submit to a

fitness for duty evaluation and/or during the time any controversy concerning the employee’s fitness for
duty is being resolved, the Department may, in its sole discretion, reassign the employee to other duties
or relieve the employee from duty. In the latter event, the employee shall be placed on paid leave of
absence status which may be revoked if the employee fails to fully cooperate with the Department or its
examining physicians and/or other licensed medical providers.

Page 90 of 95
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

Section 31.04 - Psychological Evaluations; Reasonable Basis; Appeals

No psychological evaluations shall be required in the absence of a recommendation by the Department's
examining physician or other licensed medical provider who has a reasonable basis for requiring the
psychological evaluation. If able the Department and/or Department’s examining physician shall inform
the employee of such reasonable basis at the time he/she is ordered to report for the required
psychological examination unless the examining physician or other licensed medical provider
documents with reasonable specificity that disclosure of the information in the report is likely to cause
harm to the employee or to others. In such cases, the information shall be handled and/or disclosed in a
manner consistent with prevailing medical and/or legal authority.

If the employee disputes the accuracy or legitimacy of the facts upon which the Department’s examining
physician or other licensed medical provider has relied on concluding that a reasonable basis exists for
the required psychological evaluation, the employee may file a grievance contesting the requirement that
he/she submit to the examination. In such event, the employee shall not be required to report for the
psychological evaluation until the grievance has been resolved under the expedited arbitration
procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to
making findings of fact with regard to the disputed facts underlying the reasonable basis. The arbitrator
does not have the authority to overturn the medical opinion of the examining physician or other licensed
medical provider. The Department may relieve the employee from duty without pay or reassign the
employee to other duties during the pendency of the grievance resolution proceedings but shall not
discipline or discharge the employee for refusing to submit to the psychological evaluation unless the
employee refuses to undergo psychological evaluation after an arbitrator has determined, or the
Department and the Federation agree, as to the accuracy or legitimacy of the underlying factual basis for
the referral. If an employee is relieved without pay, he/she may use available benefits in order to
continue in paid status. If an employee is relieved without pay and it is subsequently determined that the
Department lacked a reasonable basis to require a psychological evaluation, the Department shall make
the employee whole by paying the employee for lost work days and/or restoring his/her benefit banks.

Section 31.05 - Examining Physicians; Costs
The physicians and/or other licensed medical providers relied upon by the Department in the

administration of this Article shall be selected and contracted by the Department. To minimize the delay
in evaluating the employee, the Department shall have more than one physician and/or licensed medical
personnel to conduct fitness for duty evaluations. The Department shall bear all costs associated with
fitness for duty examinations required under this Article and all time required by such examinations
shall be regarded as "Work time" under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the provisions of this
Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 

Section 31.06 - Medical Records; Private

All medical data and records relied upon by the Department in the administration of this Article shall be
classified as private data on individuals as defined by the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act,
Minn. Stat. § 13.01, et. seq. All reports, correspondence, memoranda or other records which contain
medical data on an employee shall be made available only to the Chief of the Department, those who
have the authority and responsibility to represent the interests of the Department in claims involving the
Department in any forum or otherwise and others who may specifically be authorized by the employee
to receive such data. The Department shall request an opinion from the Office of the City Attorney in
instances where questions arise over the proper distribution or handling of medical data relied upon by

Page 91 of 95
Police Officers Federation ¢ 2017-2019
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

the Department in the administration of this Article or in connection with the Department's response to
any finding that an employee is not fit for duty.

Section 31.07 - Adverse Findings; Appeals
Where it is determined that an employee is not fit for duty, the examining physician shall prepare a

written report which includes:

(a) A statement as to whether the employee, is medically and/or psychologically able to
perform the essential functions of the job; and

(b) A statement of what, if any, work restrictions the employee has; and
(c) A prognosis for recovery.

A copy of the examining physician's written report shall be provided to the Chief of the Department,
those who have authority and responsibility to represent the interests of the Department in claims
involving the Department in any forum or otherwise, and others who may specifically be authorized by
the employee to receive such data.

In addition to the report provided to the Chief of the Department, the employee may also at the
discretion of the examining physician, be provided with additional information including:

(a) A specific diagnosis of the medical condition and the reasons why such problem renders
the employee unfit for duty;

(b) A statement of any accommodation that would enable the employee to perform the
essential functions of his/her job; a specific treatment plan, if any; and

(c) A prognosis for recovery and a specific schedule concerning re-examination;

unless the examining physician or other licensed medical provider documents with reasonable
specificity that disclosure of the information in the report is likely to cause harm to the employee or to
others. In such cases, the information shall be handled and/or disclosed in a manner consistent with
prevailing medical and/or legal authority.

In the event the employee disagrees with the determination of the examining physician or other licensed
medical provider that he/she is not medically, psychologically, or emotionally fit for duty, the employee
may submit medical information from a physician or other licensed medical provider of his/her own
choosing. The employee shall be responsible for all costs associated with the second opinion unless
such costs are covered by the employee's medical insurance. Where the employee's physician and the
Department's physician have issued conflicting opinions concerning the employee's fitness for duty, the
Department shall encourage the two physicians to confer with one another in an effort to resolve their
conflicting medical opinions. If they are unable to do so within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date
of the second opinion, the dispute concerning the employee's fitness for duty may be submitted by either
party to a neutral examining physician or other licensed medical provider (the “Neutral Examiner”) who
has expertise regarding the medical, psychological or emotional disorder involved and who is
knowledgeable of the environment in which law enforcement duties are performed. The decision of the
Page 92 of 95
Police Officers Federation ¢ 2017-2019
Fitness and Wellness for Duty

Neutral Examiner shall be final and binding on the parties. If the Neutral Examiner determines it
necessary, the employee shall submit to an evaluation by the Neutral Examiner. If the Neutral Examiner
determines that the employee is not fit for duty, he/she shall issue a written report which includes the
information specified above. Notwithstanding the Provisions of Section 31.05, the cost of the Neutral
Examiner, to the extent not covered by insurance, shall be split equally between the City and the
Federation. The dispute resolution procedures outlined herein shall not apply to Workers' Compensation
cases. The Federation and the Department shall establish a list of not less than three qualified Neutral
Examiners. In the event the services of a Neutral Examiner are required, the employee shall select the
Neutral examiner from the established list.

Section 31.08 - Layoff for Medical Reasons
When an employee who has been found to be not medically or psychologically fit for duty has

exhausted his/her eligibility for Family Medical Leave, sick leave, vacation, and compensatory time
banks, the employee may be laid off for medical reasons until he/she is again capable of resuming the
duties. The employee’s recall from layoff shall be governed by Section 21.03; however, the Department
may require a satisfactory medical report from the City's health services provider(s) before re-
employment. Generally, if the period of time an employee is expected to be off the job is less than six
months, a leave without pay (Medical Leave of Absence) may be more appropriate.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Medical Screening for Air Purifying Respirators

RECITALS

The City of Minneapolis (hereinafter “Employer”) and The Police Officers’ Federation of Minneapolis
(hereinafter “Federation”) are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (the “CBA”) that is
currently in force.

The Employer has determined that all sworn personnel should be fitted for Air Purifying Respirators
(“APRs”).

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) regulations provide that before fitting
employees for an APR, the employee must provide medical information by completing a questionnaire
or having a physical examination.

The Employer desires to use the medical information questionnaire for screening and to require all
sworn personnel to complete the questionnaire.

The Federation has asserted that the requirement that all employees complete the questionnaire
constitutes a “term and condition of employment” as defined by the Minnesota Public Employees Labor
Relations Act (“PELRA”).

The Federation has asserted concerns that the disclosure of medical information may have an adverse
impact on the employment status of some of its members.

The parties desire to minimize the potential for future disputes and to proceed with providing APRs to
all eligible employees on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

AGREEMENT
NOW, THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
The Employer may require all employees in the rank of Police Officer, Sergeant, Lieutenant and Captain
to complete the Respirator Certification Questionnaire (the “Questionnaire”) in the form attached hereto

as Exhibit A; provided that the same policies, practices and requirements as set forth herein are applied
to all sworn personnel employed by the Department.

Page 1 of 3
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Upon completion, the employee will place the Questionnaire in a sealed envelope and return the
envelope to his/her supervisor. All such envelopes will remain sealed and be sent to the City Doctor for
review and evaluation. After they are reviewed, the Questionnaires will be returned to the Human
Resources unit of the Department because the City Doctor does not have the capacity to store all of the
Questionnaires. The Questionnaires will be enclosed in an enveloped marked “confidential” and stored
by the Human Resources unit in a locked file cabinet. Other than filing and storing the documents and
retrieving them at the request of the employee or the City Doctor, no MPD personnel will review or be
allowed access to the contents of the Questionnaire. Further, the contents of the Questionnaire cannot be
used against the employee in any action having an adverse impact on the employee’s employment status.

If, based on the information in the Questionnaire, the City Doctor has concerns as to whether the
employee would be able to safely wear a tight fitting APR mask, the employee may be required to be
examined by the City Doctor.

If the City Doctor determines, whether by review of the Questionnaire or physical examination of the
employee, that the employee cannot wear an APR, the employee will not be issued this type of mask and
accommodations will be made for the employee to be provided with an alternative form of respiratory
protection, if needed. Further, such a determination will have no adverse impact on the employee’s
employment status or eligibility for promotion unless the City Doctor discovers a serious, threatening
health condition that would prevent the employee from safely and fully performing his/her duties as a
police officer.

If the City Doctor discovers, whether by review of the Questionnaire or physical examination of the
employee, evidence of a serious, threatening health condition that the doctor believes could prevent the
employee from safely and fully performing his/her duties as a police officer, the City Doctor shall refer
the employee to his/her personal physician. The employee shall have twenty-one (21) days from the
date of referral by the City Doctor to obtain and submit to MPD Human Resources written verification
from his/her personal physician that he/she is fit for duty. Employees who do not timely submit such
written verification shall be referred to the City Doctor for a fitness for duty evaluation. The employee’s
personal physician will be provided with documentation as to the essential function of a police officer so
he/she is able to make an informed decision as to the employee’s duty status.

If the City Doctor discovers, whether by review of the Questionnaire or physical examination of the
employee, evidence of a condition the nature of which the City Doctor believes may be immediately
life-threatening, the City Doctor shall refer the employee to his/her personal physician. In such
circumstances, the employee must be evaluated by his/her person physician before he/she can return to
work in any capacity. For the day on which such referral is made and for the next two full days
thereafter, the employee shall be placed on paid “administrative leave,” except to the extent that he/she
was not scheduled to work such days or had previously taken such days off. The employee may not
return to work until he/she has obtained and submitted to MPD Human Resources written verification
from his/her personal physician that he/she is fit to return for full duty or to return to work in some
limited capacity. If the employee is not declared fit to return to work prior to the expiration of the
Administrative Leave, he she may use accrued vacation, sick leave or compensatory time. If the
employee’s condition requires treatment and results in restrictions on his/her activities for more than one
week, the employee must be examined by the City Doctor before returning to work even when the
employee’s own physician has declared them fit for duty. Depending on the determination of the City
Doctor, the employee may be declared fit for full duty, fit for limited duty or not fit for duty. If the

Page 2 of 3
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
employee is declared fit for limited duty, the employee may be placed on limited duty status and may be
given a limited duty assignment if his/her commander determines that there is limited duty work for the
employee to do.

The CBA shall remain in full force and effect. Further, Article 31 of the CBA shall apply with regard to
the implementation of this Agreement, except that:

The failure of the employee to obtain and submit to MPD Human Resources written verification from
their personal physician that they are fit for duty within the time period set forth in paragraph 5, above,
shall constitute a circumstance in which the Department may require a fitness for duty evaluation under
Section 31.02 of the CBA.

Where the City Doctor refers the employee to his/her personal physician for an immediately life-
threatening condition and where that condition requires treatment and results in restrictions on the
employee’s activities for more than one week, such events shall constitute a circumstance in which the
Department may require a fitness for duty evaluation under Section 31.02 of the CBA.

The dispute resolution provisions of Section 31.07 of the CBA shall apply to any dispute between the
employee’s doctor(s) and the City Doctor regarding the employee’s fitness for full and unrestricted duty
that may arise from the implementation of this Agreement.

The City Doctor shall not disclose to the Department or to any of its personnel (other than the affected
employee) any specific information from the Questionnaire or from any subsequent examination of any
employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Doctor may advise the Chief of Police: is not
eligible to wear an APR; has been referred to be evaluated by his/her personal physician within 21 days;
or has been referred to be evaluated by his/her personal physician for an immediately life-threatening
condition that renders the employee unfit for duty.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
2017 Health Care Insurance

WHEREAS, the City of Minneapolis (hereinafter “City”) and the Police Officers Federation of

Minneapolis (hereinafter “Union”) are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement that is currently in
force; and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to provide quality health care at an affordable cost for the

protection of employees, which requires a modification to the current Collective Bargaining Agreement
as it relates to the funding of Health Care beginning January 1, 2017;

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the parties agree as follows for the period January 1,
2017 through December 31, 2017:

1.

The City will offer medical plans through Medica Insurance Company (“Medica”). Employees can
elect to enroll in one of six (6) provider options. Medica Elect is a managed care model, Medica
Choice is an open access model, and Fairview and North Memorial Vantage with Medica,
Inspiration Health by HealthEast with Medica, Park Nicollet First with Medica and Ridgeview
Community Network are accountable care organizations (ACOs).

Medica will continue a dual medical premium system that provides incentives for wellness
program completion. The monthly medical premiums for subscribers who earn the required
wellness program points by August 31° 2016 (the “wellness premiums”) will be lower than the
premiums for subscribers who do not earn the required wellness program points by August 31,
2016 (the “standard premiums”). Any changes to the wellness program requirements as described
in the 2016 My Health Rewards by Medica brochure which is attached hereto and incorporated
herein will be agreed upon by the Benefits Sub-committee of the Citywide Labor Management
Committee. For 2017, the “wellness premium” will also apply to all employees who are newly
enrolled in the medical plan after June 1, 2016.

For the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the City will pay $530.00 or the cost
of the premium, whichever is less, per month for employees who elect single coverage under the
medical plan.

For the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the City will pay $1,435.00 or the cost

of the premium, whichever is less, per month for employees who elect family coverage under the
medical plan.

Page 1 of 3

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
5. The City will continue the Health Reimbursement Arrangement (“the Plan”) which was
established January 1, 2004 to provide reimbursement of eligible health expenses for participating
employees, their spouse and other eligible dependents; and the Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary
Association Trust (the “Trust”) through which the Plan is funded.

6. The Plan shall be administered by the City or, at the City’s sole discretion, a third party
administrator.

7. The City shall designate a Trustee for the Trust. Such Trustee shall be authorized to hold and
invest assets of the Trust and to make payments on instructions from the City or, at the City’s
discretion, from a third party administrator in accordance with the conditions contained in the Plan.
Representatives of the City and up to three representatives selected by the Minneapolis Board of
Business Agents shall constitute the VEBA Investment Committee which shall meet periodically
to review the assets and investment options for the Trust.

 

8. The City shall pay the administration fees for Plan members who are current employees and other
expenses pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Plan members who have separated from service will be
charged the administration fee.

9. The City will make a contribution to the Plan in the annual amount of $1,080.00 for employees
who elect single coverage and $2,280.00 for employees who elect family coverage in the City of
Minneapolis Medical Plan. Such City contribution shall be made in semi-monthly installments
equal to one-twenty fourth (1/24) of the designated amount and shall be considered to be contract
value in the designated amount.

10. The Parties agree that, except for City contributions to the Plan or other negotiated payments to a
tax-qualified health savings account, incentives, discounts or special payments provided to medical
plan members that are not made to reimburse the member or his/her health care provider for health
care services covered under the medical plan (e.g. incentives to use health club memberships or
take health risk assessments) are not benefits for the purposes of calculating aggregate value of
benefits pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 471.6161, Subd. 5.

11. Future cost sharing of premium costs between the employer and employees for medical plan
and/or Plan contributions will be determined by the Benefits Sub-committee of the Citywide Labor
Management Committee; however, absent a subsequent agreement, the City shall bear 82.5% of
any generalized medical premium rate increase and the employees shall bear 17.5% of any
generalized medical premium rate increase, as determined by Medica.

12. The unions shall continue to be involved with the selection of and negotiations with the medical
plan carrier.

13. This agreement does not provide the unions with veto power over the City’s decisions.

14. This agreement does not negate the City’s obligation to negotiate with the unions as described by
Minn. Stat. § 471.6161, Subd. 5.

Page 2 of 3
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
15. The terms of this agreement shall be incorporated into the Collective Bargaining Agreement as
appropriate without additional negotiations.

16. The Parties agree to re-negotiate the terms of this agreement in the event the City decides to
implement self-insurance as the funding mechanism for the City of Minneapolis Medical Plan.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Interpretation of Section 13.05
of the Labor Agreement (Shift differential)

RECITALS

A. The City of Minneapolis (hereinafter “Employer”) and the Police Officers Federation of
Minneapolis (hereinafter “Federation”) are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (hereinafter
“Labor Agreement”) that is currently in effect.

B. Section 13.05 of the Labor Agreement provides for the payment of a shift differential
payable to employees who “work a scheduled shift in which a majority of the work hours fall between
the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.” Section 13.05 further provides that the shift differential shall be
paid “for all hours worked on such shifts.”

Cc. A dispute arose as to whether officers who do not normally work a shift qualifying for the
differential do work a scheduled shift for which a majority of the hours fall between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00
a.m. This situation occasionally occurs when a day watch officer volunteers to work a night watch shift
to cover shift minimums due to the absence (by sick leave or comp time usages) of a member of the
night watch.

D. After discussing the issue during a Labor Management Committee meeting, the parties
mutually agreed to resolve issues regarding the interpretation of Section 13.05 on the following terms
without further cost to either party.

NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:
AGREEMENT

1. The intent of Section 13.05 of the Labor Agreement is that the eligibility to receive the
shift differential is determined by the status of the shift rather than the employee; except with regard to
an employee who is assigned to a qualifying nighttime Bid Assignment, as defined by Section 17.01, (e)
or (f) of the Labor Agreement, and who is involuntarily assigned to work daytime hours.

2. Consistent with the intent expressed in Paragraph 1, above, the shift differential should be
paid when an employee works “a scheduled shift” that qualifies for the differential regardless of whether
the “scheduled shift” is that employee’s regular shift and regardless of whether the employee
volunteered to work such “scheduled shift.”

Page 1 of 2
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
3. Buy back hours worked pursuant to Section 20.03, Subd. 7 of the Labor Agreement are
not a “scheduled shift” and, therefore, do not qualify for shift differential regardless of the time of day
the buyback is worked and regardless of whether the buyback is worked by an employee who is
assigned to a nighttime Bid Assignment.

4. The shift differential is not payable when an employee officer who is assigned to a
nighttime Bid Assignment voluntarily agrees to work a “scheduled shift” for which a majority of the
hours do not fall between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

 

5. The Employer will conduct an audit of payroll records for the period from June 1, 2008,
through the implementation date of this Agreement for the purpose of identifying hours worked that
should have qualified for the payment of shift differential as determined under the Labor Agreement,
and the interpretation thereof as set forth herein, but for which the shift differential was not paid to the
employee who worked such hours. Following the conclusion of the audit, the Employer will present the
audit findings to the Federation not less than two weeks prior to the proposed date for implementing any
back pay to allow the Federation an opportunity to raise questions or concerns regarding the audit. The
audit shall be deemed final following the conclusion of the comment period. Back pay shall be paid to
affected employees pursuant to the final audit as soon as is practical.

6. The Federation waives any grievances that may have arisen prior to the date hereof on the
facts and issues addressed herein.

7. The Labor Agreement remains in full force and effect.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING
Standby Status for Specialized Investigators

RECITALS

A. WHEREAS, the City of Minneapolis (hereinafter “Employer”) and the Police Officers
Federation of Minneapolis (hereinafter “Federation’”) are parties to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement (hereinafter “Labor Agreement’) that is currently in force, and

B. WHEREAS, even though the Minneapolis Police Department (the “Department”) staffs the
Homicide Unit 24 hours per day, seven days per week, there is frequently the need for additional
investigators during the night and on weekends; and

C. WHEREAS, the prior practice (prior to December, 2004) of calling in off-duty personnel was
not always effective, did not equitably distribute the burden of intrusions into an employee’s off-
duty time, and resulted in much confusion and misunderstanding as to the expectations with
regard to an employee’s obligations and ability to decline a call-in; and

D. WHEREAS, in December, 2004, the Department implemented a new practice in which
investigators in the Homicide Unit were told that they were “on standby,” that they were
expected to report for duty if called, and that they would be subject to discipline if they did not
respond; and

E. WHEREAS, the Labor Agreement contains a provision regarding compensation for standby
status; and

F. WHEREAS, the Department did not compensate the members of the Homicide Unit Federation
for standby in accordance with the terms of the Labor Agreement; and

G. WHEREAS, the Federation filed a grievance over the compensation for standby; and
H. WHEREAS, the grievance has now been settled; and
I. WHEREAS, one element of consideration in settlement of the grievance was to establish

reasonable compensation and conditions for standby status for investigators with specialized
skills;

 

NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

Page 1 of 3
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
AGREEMENT

1. Notwithstanding the plain language of Section 20.03, Subd. 3 of the Labor Agreement to the
contrary, the terms and conditions for standby status for Sergeants assigned to the Homicide Unit (the
“Employees”) shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.

2. Employees may occasionally receive calls during their off duty hours to assist in resolving issues
may arise. It is expected that, when available, employees will respond and for such response will be
compensated pursuant to Section 20.03, Subd. 2 of the Labor Agreement. However, an employee who
does not or is unable to respond during his/her off-duty time will not be subject to discipline for such
lack of response unless he/she is “standby.”

3. The term “standby” is limited to a status in which an employee, though off duty, is required by
the Employer to refrain from the use of alcohol, be accessible and be fully prepared to report to the
Homicide Office (Room 108) within sixty (60) minutes. The employee will receive clear and written
advance notice that will specify the date and hours that he/she is to be on standby.

4. The Employer may assign employees to be on call under this Agreement for the limited purpose
of providing assistance to on-duty investigators with regard to the investigation of homicides,
kidnappings, officer involved shootings, or other serious crimes which necessitate immediate action by
investigators with specialized skills. The duration of a standby assignment shall be not more than seven
(7) consecutive days without the consent of the Employee and the Federation. The Employer will
schedule standby assignments first by seeking volunteers and then by using an equitable rotation system.
The scheduling of employees for standby should be of a reasonable duration and frequency, thus
respecting the employee’s personal life.

 

5. An employee may fulfill his/her obligation to serve a scheduled standby shift by finding a
replacement to serve on standby. If an employee elects to fill his/her shift with a replacement, the
employee originally scheduled to serve on standby shall give the Homicide Lieutenant advance written
notice of the replacement. An employee shall be excused from a scheduled standby shift if he/she is on
a pre-approved vacation or is sick.

6. An employee who is scheduled to be on standby shall be compensated with fifteen (15) minutes
at his/her regular straight time rate (including longevity and any other applicable premium or
differential) for each hour or part thereof that he/she is on standby if not called in to work. If called in to
work, the employee will not receive the standby compensation for the time spent working, but will be
compensated for such hours worked according to the call-in provisions of Section 20.03 Subd. 2 of the
Labor Agreement. An employee who is scheduled to be on standby on any of the holidays designated in
Section 23.01 shall be compensated with twenty (20) minutes at his/her regular holiday rate, as
determined under Section 20.03, Subd. 9, for each hour or part thereof that he/she is on standby.

7. An employee on standby is required to respond to telephone calls of up to an aggregate time of
thirty (30) minutes during the standby period without additional compensation. If the employee is
required to spend more than thirty (30) minutes on the telephone, the aggregate telephone time will be
treated as a call-in.

8. In order to expedite the response time of an employee who is called in to work, he/she shall be
provided with the use of a fully-equipped squad car while on standby. If called in, the employee shall
Page 2 of 3

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
sign on by radio upon departing for work and shall be compensated as working from the time of sign on
until relieved of duty by a supervisor. Because an employee is not restricted from conducting personal
business while on standby so long as he/she remains able to timely report to Room 108, reasonable
personal use of the vehicle shall be allowed while on standby.

9. This Agreement does not apply to any employee of the Department other than Sergeants
assigned to the Department’s Homicide Unit.

10. This Agreement does not apply to court standby for employees of the Department’s Homicide
Unit or to any type of standby for such employees, other than the limited scope of investigative standby
specified in paragraph 4, above.

11. The Labor Agreement remains in full force and effect, except as expressly modified by this
Memorandum.

12. The Employer acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement constitute a reduction
from the standby compensation payable under Section 20.03 Subd. 3 of the Labor Agreement and,
therefore, does not constitute an increase in the compensation payable to members of the Federation.
Accordingly, the Employer agrees that it will not and shall not assert in any forum that the existence or
terms of this Agreement create a new or additional element of compensation payable to Federation
members that should count against the Employer’s “salary cap” unilaterally imposed in January, 2003,
or against the aggregate economic value of any successor agreement to the Labor Agreement.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Job Bank and Related Matters

The above-entitled Parties are signatory to a Labor Agreement which most recently took effect on
January 1, 2017 (the “Labor Agreement”). This Letter of Agreement outlines additional agreements
reached by the Parties during the course of the collective bargaining which resulted in the making of the
Agreement and which the Parties now desire to confirm.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

The Employer has created a job bank as a component of its resources allocation (budget) process. The
purpose of the Job Bank is to assist the Employer and its employees during a time of major restructuring
and change caused by unyielding demands for municipal service in the face of decreasing funding. It is
the Employer’s intention, to the extent feasible under these circumstances, to identify employment
opportunities for employees whose positions are eliminated through reassignment, retraining and out-
placement support. One of the purposes of the Job Bank process is to minimize, to the extent possible,
the disruption normally associated with contractual “bumping” and layoff procedures to both the
Employer and affected employees.

The Job Bank process shall be administered in a manner which is consistent with the Employer’s desire
to treat affected employees with dignity and respect at a difficult time in their relationship and to provide
as much information and assistance to them as may be reasonably possible and practical within the
limited resources available.

The term “Recall List” as used in this Agreement means the list of employees who are laid off from
employment with the City or removed from their position by reason of a reduction in the size of the
workforce, and who retain a right to return to their prior job classification pursuant to the terms of the
Labor Agreement and/or Civil Service rules.

JOB BANK PROCESS AND PROCEDURE
I. Job Bank Assignment

1. Regular (permanently certified) employees whose positions are eliminated shall receive
formal, written notification to that effect from the appointing authority of the department to
which they are assigned. If a position is to be eliminated in any department, the employee
with the least amount of seniority in the particular job class within the impacted

Page 1 of 6
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
division/department will be placed in the job bank, regardless of performance, assignment,
function or other consideration. For the purposes of this section, a division is defined as an
operational unit headed by a supervisory director or deputy who reports directly to a
department head. If a department is of such a size as to have no distinct divisions, the
department shall be treated as a division. Whether the layoff will be implemented relative to
the least senior in a division or department will be determined by the terms of the Labor
Agreement covering the impacted positions.

Such employees shall be assigned to the Job Bank. Employees whose positions have been
eliminated based on the Employer’s regular annual budget process, including the Mayor’s
proposed budget and/or the final annual City budget as passed by the City Council, or as
otherwise ordered by the City Council, are entitled to a sixty (60) day tenure in the job bank.
All positions eliminated based on the Mayor’s proposed budget and/or the final annual City
budget as passed by the City Council must be so eliminated after the Mayor’s proposed
budget is announced but no later than January 1, of the next budget cycle (unless the
department/division intends to eliminate at a later date as part of their final annual budget for
that year). Employees whose positions have been eliminated based on any mid-cycle budget
or revenue reductions not controlled by the Mayor and the City Council, are entitled to a
thirty (30) day tenure in the job bank, or until they are reassigned, whichever may first occur.
All such employees in the Job Bank shall have extended job bank services for as long as they
remain on a recall list. During such period such laid off employees shall form a pool for
“restricted examination” for positions for which they may be qualified. The employee will
notify the City of their interest in being considered. The Union will assist in notifying these
employees of vacancies to be filled. A permit position shall be considered a “vacancy” if it is
in a job classification impacted by the workforce reduction and if more than 60 days remain
on the permit.

Permit and temporary employees whose employment is terminated are not eligible for Job
Bank assignment or benefits. Certified temporary employees shall, however, be eligible for
the Job Bank activities described in paragraphs 2(c) below.

II. Job Bank Activities

1.

While affected employees are assigned to the Job Bank, they shall continue in their
positions with no change in pay or benefits. While so assigned, however, affected
employees may be required to perform duties outside of their assigned job classifications
and/or they may be required to perform such duties at a different location as determined
by the Employer.

While affected employees are assigned to the Job Bank, the Employer shall make
reasonable efforts to identify vacant positions within its organization which may provide
continuing employment opportunities and which may be deemed suitable for affected
employees by all concerned.

a. Lateral Transfer. Employees may request to be transferred to a vacant position
in another job classification at the same MCSC Grade level provided they meet
the minimum qualifications for the position.

Page 2 of 6

Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
i. Seniority Upon Transfer. In addition to earning job classification seniority
in their new title, transferred employees shall continue to accrue job
classification seniority in their former title and they shall have the right to
return to their former title if the position to which they have transferred is
later eliminated. In the event the transfer is to a formerly held job
classification, seniority in the new (formerly held) title shall run from the
date upon which they were first certified to the former classification.

 

ii. Pay Upon Transfer. The employee’s salary in the new position will be
their former salary or that of the next available step in the pay progression
schedule for the new title which provides for an increase in salary if no
equal pay progression step exists. If the employee’s salary in the former
position is greater than the maximum salary applicable to the new title, the
employee’s salary will be red circled until the maximum salary for the
new title meets the employees’ red circled rate. Such employees shall,
however, be eligible for fifty percent (50%) of the negotiated general
increase occurring during the term of the Agreement. Lateral transfers
shall not affect anniversary dates of employment for pay progression
purposes.

iii. Probationary Periods. Employees transferring to a different title will serve
a six (6) calendar month probationary period. In the event the
probationary period is not satisfactorily completed, the affected employee
shall be returned to Job Bank assignment and the employee’s “bumping”,
layoff or transfer rights under the Agreement or other applicable authority
shall be restored to the same extent such rights existed prior to the
employee taking the probationary position. Upon the affected employee’s
first such return to the Job Bank, the employee shall be entitled to remain
in the Job Bank for the greater of ten (10) business days, or the duration of
the applicable Job Bank period, as determined under Article I, paragraph
2, that remained as of the date the employee began in the probationary
position. The rate of compensation for the remainder of the employee’s
time in the Job Bank will be the same as the rate in effect as of the
employee’s last day in the probationary position. Return to the Job Bank
terminates the employee’s work in the probationary assignment and,
therefore, time served following the return to the Job Bank shall not be
construed to count toward the completion of the probationary period.

  

b. Filling Vacant Positions. During the time the procedures outlined herein are in
effect, position vacancies to be filled shall first be offered to regular employees
who have a contractual right to be recalled to a position in the involved job
classification or who may have a right to “bump” or transfer to the position, as the
case may be. In such circumstances, the seniority provisions of the Agreement
shall be observed. If no regular employee has a contractual right to the position,
the following shall be given consideration in the order (priority) indicated below:

3" Priority: Employee applicants from a list of eligibles

4" Priority: Displaced certified temporary employees

5" Priority: Non-employee applicants from a list of eligibles

The qualifications of an employee in the Job Bank or on a recall list shall be
reviewed to determine whether he/she meets the qualifications for a vacant
position. Whether the employee can be trained for a position within a reasonable
time (not to exceed three months) shall be considered when determining the
qualifications of an employee. If it is determined that the employee does not meet
the qualifications for a vacant position, the employee may appeal to the Director
of Human Resources. If it is determined that an employee in the Job Bank is
qualified for a vacant position, the employee shall be selected. The appointing
authority may appeal the issue of whether the employee is qualified. The dispute
shall be presented to and resolved by the Job Bank Steering Committee.

If it is determined that an employee on a recall list is qualified for a vacant
position, the employee will be given priority consideration and may be selected.
Appeals regarding employees on a recall list and their qualifications for a position
will be handled by the Civil Service Commission.

The grievance procedure under the Labor Agreement shall not apply to
determinations as to qualifications of the employee for a vacant position.

3. During their assignment to the Job Bank, affected employees will be provided an
opportunity to meet with the Employer’s Placement Coordinator to discuss such matters
as available employment opportunities with the Employer, skills assessments, training
and/or retraining opportunities, out-placement assistance and related job transition
subjects. Involvement in these activities will be at the discretion of the employee.
Further, affected employees will be granted reasonable time off with pay for the purpose
of attending approved skills assessment, training and job search activities. Displaced
certified temporary employees are eligible for the benefits described in this paragraph.
These services shall be provided to the Job Bank employee at no cost to the employee.

   

III. Layoff, Bumping and Retirement Considerations

1. A “Primary Impact Employee” is an employee who enters the Job Bank due to the
elimination of his/her position. A “Secondary Impact Employee” is an employee who
enters the Job Bank because he/she may be displaced by a Primary Impact Employee.
All affected employees may exercise the displacement, “bumping” and/or layoff rights
immediately. A Primary Impact Employee must exercise displacement or bumping rights
within forty-five (45) days of entering the Job Bank (or within twenty-two [22] days of
entering the Job Bank for an employee entitled to 30-days in the Job Bank). A Primary
Impact Employee who exercises his/her displacement or bumping rights within the first
thirty (30) days from entering the Job Bank (within the first fifteen [15] days for an
employee entitled to 30-days in the Job Bank) shall have 8 hours added to the employee’s

Page 4 of 6
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
vacation bank. A Secondary Impact Employee must exercise his/her displacement or
bumping rights within seven (7) calendar days of being displaced or bumped.
Displacement and bumping rights shall be forfeited unless exercised by the deadlines
specified in this paragraph or in the provisions of 2.a iii, Lateral Transfers, above.
Regardless of when bumping rights are exercised, any change in the compensation of the
employee resulting from the exercise of bumping rights shall not take effect until after the
employee’s term in the Job Bank would have expired had the employee remained in the
Job Bank for the maximum period.

2. If an affected employee is unable to exercise any “bumping” rights, or forfeits their
bumping rights, under the Agreement or other authority and has not been placed in
another City position, the employee shall be laid off and placed on the appropriate recall
list with all rights pursuant to the relevant Labor Agreement provisions, if any, and all
applicable Civil Service rules. In addition, they shall be eligible for the benefits
described as follows:

(a) The level of coverage, single or family, shall continue at the level of coverage
in effect for the laid off employee as of the date of layoff.

(b) The health/dental plan that shall be continued shall be the plan in effect for the
employees as of the date of layoff.

(c) The City shall pay one hundred (100) percent of the premiums for the first six (6)
months of COBRA continuance at the level of coverage and plan selected by the
employee and in effect on the date of the layoff.

The terms of this provision relating to the continuation of insurance benefits will expire
on December 31, 2019. The City Council must take specific action to extend these terms
relating to the continuation of insurance benefits if the City Council wants those specific
insurance benefits to apply to laid off employees after December 31, 2019.

3. If eligible, affected employees may elect retirement from active employment under the
provisions of an applicable pension or retirement plan. In such event, affected employees
will be eligible for any available Retirement Incentive that is agreed to by the Parties.

4. Notwithstanding any provision in ordinance or Civil Service Rules to the contrary, an
employee who, pursuant to the terms of this Job Bank Agreement:

i. was designated for lay off and accepts a position with the City that is not
represented by this bargaining unit;

ii. is transferred to a position outside the bargaining unit; or

iii. is reassigned to a position outside the bargaining unit;

 

shall be placed on a Recall List and thereby remain eligible to be recalled to the position
he/she was in prior to entering the Job Bank.

IV. Dispute Resolution.

Disputes regarding the application or interpretation of this Agreement are subject to the grievance

Page 5 of 6
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
procedure under the Labor Agreement between the parties, except as specifically provided here. A
dispute regarding the application or interpretation of this Agreement that needs to be resolved during an
employee’s time in the Job Bank may be submitted to the Job Bank Steering Committee. The decision
of the Job Bank Steering Committee will be binding on the parties. Submission to the Job Bank
Steering Committee shall not preclude the filing of a grievance on the issue. However, the decision of
the Steering Committee shall be admissible in an arbitration hearing on such grievance.

The provisions of this Letter of Agreement associated with the Job Bank Program shall become effective
upon the approval of the Employer’s Council and Mayor. The Job Bank procedures outlined herein
shall be observed after the negotiated termination date of the Labor Agreement between the Parties, and
expire on December 31, 2019.

To the extent that there is any conflict between the terms of this Letter of Agreement and the Labor
Agreement, the Labor Agreement shall prevail.

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties have caused this Letter of Agreement to be executed by their duly
authorized representative whose signatures appear below.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
Duty Status Review Process

The above-entitled Parties are signatory to a Labor Agreement which most recently took effect on
January 1, 2017 (the “Labor Agreement”). This Memorandum of Agreement outlines additional
agreements reached by the Parties during the course of the collective bargaining which resulted in the
making of the Agreement and which the Parties now desire to confirm.

1. The Duty Status Review Process (“DSRP”) described in this Memorandum of Agreement
(“MOA”) shall be used to resolve disputes as to whether the criteria for retention of the
employee on administrative leave/limited duty status under Section 26.02, subd. 2 are
satisfied.

2. Notifications sent under this MOA shall be made in the manner and to the individuals as
provided in Section 11.04 of the Labor Agreement. However, the time lines referenced in
Article 11 of the Labor Agreement do not apply to the DSRP.

3. During the initial discussion (see Section 26.01, Subd. 4 of the Labor Agreement) between
the Chief and a Federation representative upon the placement of an employee on
administrative leave or limited duty status and subsequent discussions thereafter, the parties
shall address, among other things, the following:

a. The nature and severity of the allegation;

b. The evidence known to date, the expected timeline of the investigation (and, if a
subsequent discussion, the progress that has been made since the last discussion);

c. The employee’s appropriate duty status and any restrictions relating thereto, such as:

paid administrative leave

limited duty

eligibility for uniformed off-duty employment
eligibility for non-uniformed off-duty employment
eligibility for overtime work

d. The rationale for the determination.

Page 1 of 5
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
4. The DSRP may be initiated, after the employee has been on administrative leave or limited
duty status for 30 days and after a meeting between the parties, or upon the failure of the
Chief to meet within 10 days of a request for a meeting, by giving written notice containing
the following information:

a. The name of the employee.

b. The employee’s assignment prior to placement on administrative leave or limited
duty status.

c. The duty status of the employee and any limitations on off-duty and/or overtime work
and the date on which such status and limitations were imposed.

d. The date of prior reviews of the employee’s duty status and/or restrictions, if any.

e. A description of the allegations against the employee which resulted in the placement
on administrative leave or limited duty status.

5. Following notification to the Employer, the Director of Human Resources shall contact the
panel of umpires established under this MOA by broadcast email (with a copy to the
Employer and Federation) to give notice that a dispute is pending and seeking availability to
consider the case and render a decision within 14 days. The first three umpires to respond
with concurring available dates shall be selected. If fewer than three umpires are available
within 14 days, the matter shall proceed with two umpires or, if the parties agree, one umpire.
Upon determination of the umpires to consider the matter, the parties shall establish the date,
time and place to convene the panel for the meeting.

 

6. The parties shall submit the nature of the dispute and their evidence and arguments by
presentation at the panel meeting. All submissions, whether oral or in writing, shall be
limited to information relevant to the nature of the allegation(s) under investigation and the
evidence relating to the merits of such allegation(s).

7. Written materials may be submitted to the panel in conjunction with the presentation,
provided copies of all such materials were provided to the opposing party at least 24 hours in
advance. The presentations shall be made on behalf of the Federation by a Board member
and on behalf of the Employer by a member of the Police Administration and not by lawyers
or other representatives of the parties. Each party shall have no more than one hour to make
its presentation to the panel, including any questions posed by the panel. Following the
presentation by both parties, each party shall have up to 15 minutes for a rebuttal or a closing
statement.

8. Following the presentations by the parties, the panel shall consider the limited issue(s) of:

a. whether the allegation(s) is of a nature severe enough to limit the work assignment of
the employee; and/or

Page 2 of 5
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
b. whether there is sufficient reliable evidence to support a preliminary conclusion that
such allegation(s) may be sustained; and/or

c. whether, if the dispute arises more than 60 days after the placement of the employee
on administrative leave or limited duty status and at least 30 days after a prior review
of the status of the investigation, the duty status of the employee should be modified
by reason of the failure of the Employer to proceed with the investigation in a timely
manner. The standard of review as to whether insufficient progress toward
completion of the investigation has occurred since the prior review shall include
consideration of the following:

i. No change in duty status is justified if the failure to make reasonable progress
on the investigation is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the
Employer;

ii. The mere referral of the investigation to another agency does not constitute
“circumstances beyond the control of the Employer.”

9. The panel of umpires shall render its decision to the parties in writing as to whether, upon
consideration of the issues set forth in paragraph 8, above, the duty status of the employee is
to remain as is or be modified. If modified, the panel shall specify whether the employee’s
status is to be:

a. modified from administrative leave to limited duty status; or

b. modified from administrative leave or limited duty status to the duty assignment to
which the employee was assigned immediately prior to placement on administrative
leave or limited duty.

The panel may, but is not required to, provide a short statement describing the rationale of its
decision.

10. The decision of the panel is final and binding on the parties based on the facts and
circumstances known at the time of the decision. The panel’s decision is limited to the issue
of the employee’s duty status pending the outcome of the investigation. The decision of the
panel does not establish any precedent regarding the just cause for discipline or for the level
of any discipline and the decision of the panel is not admissible in any hearing or proceeding
contesting such discipline.

11. The DSRP may be invoked more than once for the same employee with regard to his/her
duty status pending investigation of the same allegations, subject to the provisions for
periodic review under Section 26.02, Subd. 2 of the Labor Agreement. To the extent
possible, the same panel members shall be used for additional deliberations relating to the
same allegations, or new allegations flowing therefrom, against an employee.

12. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a panel decision does not preclude return of an employee to
administrative leave or limited duty status if new reliable evidence is discovered with regard

Page 3 of 5
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
to the allegation(s) or other severe allegations. In such case, the process described in
paragraphs 3 through 10 shall be followed as if a new allegation had been made, except that
the DSRP can be initiated prior to the expiration the 30-day “discretionary period” that would
normally apply when an employee is first placed on administrative leave or limited duty
status.

13. The Panel of Umpires.

a. The panel of umpires shall consist of not less than five (5) people mutually agreeable
to the parties.

b. To establish the panel of umpires, each party shall submit to the President of the
Board of Business Agents (unless the President is a representative of the Federation,
in which case the submission shall be made to a mediator from the Bureau of
Mediation Services) a list of ten candidates for consideration. All persons whose
names appear on both lists shall be placed on the panel, unless the parties agree to
limit the number. If the initial submission of lists does not result in at least five (5)
umpires for the panel, the parties will repeat the process with lists of three names each
until they reach the required minimum number. Once the people to serve on the panel
have been identified, a representative of each party will jointly contact the individuals
to confirm their availability and willingness to be included on the panel and serve in
the capacity of umpire. If any person declines, the selection process described herein
will continue until the panel is filled with the minimum number.

c. An umpire will be removed from the panel upon the occurrence of any of the
following events:

(1) written mutual agreement between the parties;

(2) the umpire has resigned, retired, died, become disabled or has been
unavailable to hear cases for a period of longer than twelve (12) months;

(3) the umpire no longer maintains a residence in the State of Minnesota.

d. To fill a vacancy on the panel of umpires, the parties shall follow the process
specified in subsection b, above, except that the number of candidates on the initial
list shall be the number of vacancies plus two.

e. The compensation payable to an umpire for the service in considering and deciding a
case shall be $500, which shall be split equally between the parties.

f. Periodically, but not less than once every three (3) years, the Parties will review the
list, re-verify each umpire’s availability and commitment, and set the fee structure.

14. This MOA will be appended to the Labor Agreement and will renew automatically with each
successor Labor Agreement unless terminated or amended by the written agreement of the
Parties.

14. The Human Resources Department, after consultation with the Police Administration and

Page 4 of 5
Police Officers Federation * 2017-2019
Federation, may develop forms, practices and other procedures for implementing this
Agreement. However, such items shall not modify or supersede the provisions of this

Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties have caused this Letter of Agreement to be executed by their duly
authorized representative whose signatures appear below.
