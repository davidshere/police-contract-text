DEFINITIONS:

A. The terms "sworn member", "member" and "employee" shall mean all sworn members of
the Cincinnati Police Department who serve as Police Officers and Police Specialists.

ARTICLE I
Recognition

For the contract period (May 25, 2014 through May 21, 2016) and for a continuing period
thereafter, unless either party gives written notice of its intention to repudiate this clause, the City
agrees to recognize the FOP as the exclusive bargaining agent with exclusive bargaining rights
for all sworn members of the Cincinnati Police Department up to and including the rank of
Specialist.

"Exclusive bargaining rights" shall be interpreted to mean that the City shall not
negotiate, meet or confer with any person, group of persons, associations or unions other than the
Fraternal Order of Police, Queen City Lodge No. 69, for purpose of effecting or attempting to
effect a change in the terms of this Agreement as it applies to any provision of this contract, and
shall not permit any City employee or agent to adopt or continue any policy, procedure or
program which is in conflict with any provision of this contract.

ARTICLE II
Management Rights

The FOP recognizes that, except as provided in this labor agreement, the City of
Cincinnati retains the following management rights as set forth in Ohio Revised Code Section
4117.08(C) 1-9:

1. To determine matters of inherent managerial policy which include, but are not limited to
areas of discretion or policy such as the functions and programs of the public employer,
standards of services, its overall budget, utilization of technology and organizational

structure;

2. To direct, supervise, evaluate or hire employees;

3. To maintain and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations;

4, To determine the overall methods, process, means, or personnel by which governmental

7. To determine the overall mission of the employer as a unit of government;

8. To effectively manage the work force;

9. To take actions to carry out the mission of the public employer as a governmental unit.

With respect to these management rights, the City of Cincinnati shall have the clear and
“exclusive right to make decisions in all areas and such decisions, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

1
Non-Supervisors

The City is not required to bargain on subjects reserved to the management and direction
of the City in Revised Code Section 4117.08 except as affect wages, hours, terms and conditions
of employment and the continuation, modification, or deletion of this collective bargaining
agreement. The FOP may raise a legitimate complaint or file a grievance based on this collective
bargaining agreement.

ARTICLE TT
Grievance Procedure

All sworn members of the Cincinnati Police Department shall be entitled to the following
grievance procedures:

Section 1. Definition of Grievance

A grievance shall be an allegation that the terms of the written Agreement between the
FOP and the City have been violated or misinterpreted or when there is a difference of opinion as
to the application of the same, interpretation of same, or a disagreement as to whether the City
has disciplined an employee for just cause.

Disciplinary actions subject to this grievance and arbitration procedure shall include all
disciplinary actions except for discharges and terminations. Employees who are discharged or
terminated shall, at his or her option, select this grievance and arbitration procedure. In the
alternative, said discharged or terminated employees may appeal their discharges through the
state civil service laws. In the event said terminated employee selects this grievance and
arbitration procedure, his or her rights to proceed under the state civil service laws shall be
considered waived, and this grievance and arbitration procedure shall be final and binding upon
the parties. In the event said terminated employee elects to proceed under state civil service law,
he or she shall have an additional thirty (30) days in which to convert the appeal to the grievance
arbitration process. It is understood by the parties that no member shall have the right to both a
civil service hearing and a grievance arbitration hearing.

Disciplinary grievances involving suspensions of more than five (5) days without pay,
demotion, discharge or termination shall advance automatically to Step 6 of the grievance
procedure.

Disciplinary Grievances of all pay step denials and disciplinary penalties of five (5) days
or less shall be submitted to either Peer Review or the Civil Service Commission ("CSC"). A
Peer Review Panel shall be established at each sworn rank consisting of volunteers at that rank
who shall serve for a period of one (1) year.

For each case, five (5) prospective panelists shall be selected by lot by drawing names out
of a black bag in the presence of the Police Chief and the FOP President, or their designated
representatives. The City and the member shall each strike one (1) panelist and the remaining
three (3) panelists shall hear the matter under appeal.
Non-Supervisors

The Panel shall hear the case within fourteen (14) calendar days after its selection and
shall determine if there was just cause for the pay step denial or disciplinary penalty. The Panel
may affirm, reverse or reduce the denial or penalty and shall issue its written decision within
seven (7) calendar days. The decision of the Peer Review Panel shall be final and binding. A
panel may hear all pending disciplinary cases related to a particular incident if all charged
officers are of the same rank.

All matters submitted to the CSC shall proceed pursuant to state law. Choice of CSC or
Peer Review shall be at the option of the member and shall be mutually exclusive.

Eligibility to be a peer review panelist shall be limited to sworn members with at least
three (3) years experience in the Police Department. Panelists may not have any sustained
suspensions or demotions within the previous three (3) years. Each prospective panelist must
undergo two (2) hours of mutually developed mandatory training.

The member shal! be entitled to a representative of his/her choice and to call witnesses.
The Peer Review Panel shall be entitled to review all investigative records, interviews or any
other records related to the issue to be decided.

All Peer Review Panel members shall be free from coercion, intimidation, discrimination,
threats or other detrimental actions based on their activities in the Peer Review Process and shall
not be subject to transfer in retaliation for such Peer Review activities.

The grievance and arbitration machinery of this agreement shall be the sole recourse
available to employees who receive disciplinary penalties less than termination or discharge
subject to this agreement, and is in lieu of the procedures and provisions of Section 124.01 et seq.
of the Revised Code or related provisions of the City Code or charter.

Section 2. Who May File

i, Due to the fact that the FOP is the exclusive bargaining agent for all members,
and the City has expressed its prior intent to refuse to recognize any grievance not previously
reviewed, approved and filed by the FOP, any member believing he has a grievance shall discuss
the matter with his immediate supervisor and attempt to resolve the stated problem. The matter
must be brought to the attention of the immediate supervisor within fifteen (15) calendar days of
the date on which the member becomes aware of the incident or condition precipitating the
problem. If the problem is not resolved through discussion with the immediate supervisor within
thirty (30) working days of the date on which the member becomes aware of the incident or
condition precipitating the problem, it may be presented to the FOP for its consideration as a
grievance.

After reviewing the complaint, the FOP, at its discretion, may initiate a grievance at Step
One relative to the complaint. All grievances shall be reduced to writing, contain a full statement
of particulars, and be filed on forms approved by the FOP, at the appropriate levels as set forth in
this Agreement.
Non-Supervisors

The FOP may also initiate, at Step Two, a grievance in its own name on behalf of the
membership, provided such grievance is filed in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days from
the date the FOP becomes aware of the incident alleged to be a violation of this Agreement.

2. The FOP, or its designated representative, shall be granted reasonable on duty
time to investigate, prepare and/or file a grievance. Witnesses who are reasonably necessary to
the resolution of the grievance and who are employees of the City of Cincinnati, shall be allowed
to attend any hearing resulting from the filing of a grievance. Any member who is on duty and
required by either the City or the FOP to attend a grievance hearing shall be released from duty to
attend. Any member who is off duty and required to attend a grievance hearing by the FOP shall
not be compensated by the City.

Any member who is off duty and required to attend a grievance hearing by the City shall
be granted a minimum of 3 hours compensation (2 hours X 1-1/2). Any time over 2 hours shall
also be compensated for at 1-1/2 rates.

At any step of this grievance procedure, the FOP shall have the final authority in respect
to any aggrieved member to decline to process further a grievance, if, in the judgment of the
FOP, such grievance lacks merit or justification under the terms of this agreement, or has been
adjusted or rectified under the terms of this agreement to the satisfaction of the FOP. No
provision in the agreement shall be interpreted to require the FOP to represent a member in any
stage of the grievance procedure if it considers the grievance to be without merit or in
contradiction of any law or regulation.

Section 3. Steps

Step One

Matters not resolved by initial discussion with the immediate supervisor shall be
presented to the Relief or Unit Commander within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date on
which the member becomes aware of the incident or condition precipitating the grievance. The
Relief or Unit Commander shal] indicate thereon, in writing, his response to the grievance by the
end of relief on the fifth calendar day following the day on which the written grievance was
presented. The written grievance containing the response of the Relief or Unit Commander shall

grievance has been reduced to writing, no material change may be made in the subject matter of
the grievance.

Step Two

Grievances not settled in the first step shall be delivered to the District or Section
Commander within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the written response from the Relief
or Unit Commander. The District or Section Commander shall, in conjunction with the
appropriate Bureau Commander, investigate the allegations contained in the grievance. Within
seven (7) calendar days after submission to him, the District or Section Commander shall prepare
a written response to the grievance and provide the individual or organization filing the grievance
and the Chief of Police with a copy of his response. If the response prepared by the District or
Non-Supervisors

Section Commander is not satisfactory, then the party filing the grievance shall have seven (7)
calendar days to appeal the grievance to the Third Step.

grievance shali be submitted to the Chief of Police who shall review the grievance. Within seven
(7) calendar days after its submission to him, the Chief of Police shall issue a written decision
and a copy of the decision shall be delivered to the individual or organization filing the
grievance. If the decision of the Chief of Police is not satisfactory, then the party filing the
grievance shall have seven (7) calendar days in which to appeal the grievance to the Fourth Step.

Step Four

If the decision of the Chief of Police is not satisfactory, then the grievance shall be
submitted to the Assistant or Deputy City Manager. The Assistant or Deputy City Manager shall
submit his written decision to the party or organization filing the grievance not later than fourteen
(14) calendar days after receipt of the grievance by the Assistant or Deputy City Manager. If the
decision of the Assistant or Deputy City Manager is not satisfactory, the individual or
organization filing the grievance shall have seven (7) calendar days to appeal the grievance to the
Fifth Step.

Step Five

If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual or organization filing
the grievance, then the individual or organization filing the grievance shall notify the City
Manager in writing, within seven (7) calendar days after the decision of the Assistant or Deputy
City Manager, that the grievance has not been resolved. The City Manager shall review the
grievance and shall prepare a written decision to the grievance within fourteen (14) calendar days
after receipt of the decision of the Assistant or Deputy City Manager. A copy of the decision
shall be delivered to the individual or organization filing the grievance. If the aggrieved party is
dissatisfied with the decision of the City Manager, the grievant shall have thirty (30) calendar
days to appeal the grievance to the Sixth Step.

Step Six

Mediation: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision or adjustment at Step Five,
then the individual or organization filing the grievance and the City may submit the matter for
grievance mediation in accordance with the procedures in Appendix B hereto.

Arbitration: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision or adjustment at Step Five,
an arbitrator, acceptable to both parties, shall be appointed. The American Arbitration
Association (AAA) shall be contacted by the Union, in writing, to obtain a list of arbitrators
within ten (10) calendar days after the receipt of the decision or adjustment of the City Manager
or his representative, with a copy to the Police Chief and appropriate Deputy or Assistant City
Manager. The parties shall move to select an arbitrator within twenty (20) calendar days of the
date AAA transmits the list of arbitrators. AAA rules shall apply to all arbitration procedures,
including the selection of arbitrators. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding. The cost of
the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties. The Union and the City shall each share the
filing fees, administrative fees, or panel fees charged by the AAA. The City, however, shall pay

5
Non-Supervisors

all such administrative fees, filing fees or panel fees in the event a terminated employee selects
this grievance and arbitration procedure in lieu of his or her rights to proceed under the civil
service laws for cases involving employment terminations. The expense of the expert witnesses
shall be paid by the party producing same; and, in the event there is a transcript of proceedings,
the party ordering the transcript shall be responsible for the cost of said transcript.

The Arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from, or
alter, change or modify the terms of this agreement and his/her power shall be limited to
interpretation or application of the express terms of this agreement.

Section 4, Time Limits

It shall be the obligation of the grievant to file his grievance within the proper time limit.
Any grievant who is not satisfied with the decision must file his grievance with the proper party
at the next step. Grievances not pursued by the grievant within the stated time limit shall be
deemed to have been resolved. A failure by a supervisor or management representative to
respond within the proper time shall allow the grievant to proceed to the next step.

Section 5. Legal Representation

The individual or organization filing the grievance shall have the right to be represented
by legal counsel at any time after the completion of Step Two of this procedure.

Section 6. Employee Protection

All employees shall be free from any and all restraint, interference, coercion or reprisal on
the part of their supervisors in filing any grievance or appeal, or in seeking information relating
to the grievance. The above principles apply equally after final resolution of the grievance.
Section 7. Emergency Condition

Commission or the courts, except written or oral reprimands and Forms 475, shall be subject to
review through Steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the grievance procedure.

may be removed without right of appeal after the employee has worked six (6) months of his/her

for the position of Police Recruit.

or members of the FOP and which are not covered by the grievance procedure or are not under

ARTICLE VI
Agency Shop/Free Check-Off

Effective January 1, 1985, all employees in the bargaining unit who are not members in
good standing with the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) shall pay a fair share fee to the FOP. The
fair share fee shall be the amount paid by members of the bargaining unit who are now members
of the FOP.

of the FOP shall pay fair share fee to the FOP effective the employee's date of hire.

The bi-weekly fair share fee amount shall be certified to the City by the FOP.

The deduction of the fair share fee from the earnings of the employee shall be automatic

member voluntarily requests to be withheld and forward payment to the Police Credit Union.

ARTICLE VIT
Wages and Benefits

Section 1. Wages

Wage rates under this Agreement are established for the appropriate classifications in
Division 2 of Chapter 307 of the Cincinnati Municipal Code. A schedule of those rates is
marked as Exhibit "A" and attached hereto and made a part hereof.

All sworn members of the Cincinnati Police Department covered by this Agreement shall
be paid bi-weekly. All new sworn employees in the Cincinnati Police Department shall start on
the first step of any pay range.

Pay increases (step-ups) shall be made upon recommendation of the department head and
with the approval of the City Manager. Reinstated employees are considered new employees for
the purposes of salary increases. Employees recalled from lay-off shall start on their old salary
step and shall receive credit for the time worked in the classification since the date of hire or date
of last merit increase. Employees returning from military leave shall receive service credit for

10
Non-Supervisors

salary step-up for all time spent in military service. Increases caused by a change in the salary
ordinance shal! be processed automatically by the City Human Resources Department.

When an employee is demoted, for other than disciplinary reasons, the pay should be the
same rate of pay if the new classification contains such a rate; otherwise, at the rate of pay lower
than rate before demotion. A disciplinary demotion in and of itself shall not prevent the
employee from receiving his/her next scheduled step-up. However, no employee can get a salary
step in the lower classification which is higher than that step which he would have been on had
he been in that classification originally without approval of the Civil Service Commission.

Section 2. Holiday/Compensatory Time

All sworn members of the Cincinnati Police Department shall receive on January 1 of
each year one hundred twenty (120) hours of compensatory time plus eight (8) hours or any
equivalent portion thereof, for any special holiday or partial holiday. The authority to grant
special holidays, including days of mourning, shall rest with the City Manager. However, if the
City Manager grants a special holiday to members of AFSCME, Ohio Council 8 or the Cincinnati
Fire Fighters Local 48, it shall also be granted to all sworn members of the Cincinnati Police
Department.

Each sworn member of the Cincinnati Police Department shall have the option in June of
each year to sell back up to eighty (80) hours of the member's earned and accumulated
compensatory time. The City has the option to buy back more compensatory time in September
if the member is in agreement.

In addition, any sworn member having twenty-two (22) years of service credit or more

Section 18. Sick Leave

Members shall be credited with two hours of sick leave for each week of service. Sick
leave may be used when a member is quarantined or physically unable to work because of
sickness or an off-duty injury. Sickness or injury caused by outside employment which results in

of police service.

illness or injury affects a member of the immediate family:

A. The member of the immediate family is the husband, wife, parent, parent-in-law, child,

sick person, or

Cc. In the case of hospitalization, the following shall apply:
Three days shall be granted to all sworn members of the Cincinnati Police Department in

to the hospital for the purpose of giving birth, one day on the day the spouse gives birth
and one day on the day the child is brought home.

SWP-A (Adoption). In the event that a member adopts a

Child under the age of twelve (12), the Member may take up to twenty-four (24) hours of leave
time when the child is brought home, provided that such days are on a workday or immediately
before or after a workday for the Member. This leave time will be charged to SWP, vacation, or
holiday comp. time at the discretion of the member and is limited to twenty-four (24) hours per
adoption. The Employee must notify their supervisor at least two (2) weeks in advance of the
arrival of the adopted child. However, emergency situations will not automatically result in
denial.

SWP-M. Employees will be allowed to use sick leave credit for the period during which
they are physically unable to work due to pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, a related medical
procedure or recovery, therefrom.

The duration of this leave shall be determined on an individual basis by the employee and

expected date of departure. Employees experiencing unexpected emergencies will not be
penalized for failure to give proper notification.

All swom members of the Cincinnati Police Department who are off sick or injured,
whether service connected, or not, shall be carried on an "unrestricted" basis. No member will be
considered on restricted status unless so ordered by the City/Police Physician. The question of
whether a member on sick leave shall be restricted to his or her home shall be left to the
discretion of the City/Police Physician. The extent of the restriction shall be determined by the
City/Police Physician. The City/Police Physician shall consult with the employee's personal or
attending physician in making his determination of whether or not to grant or continue the
"unrestricted" basis. No City employee shall in any way attempt to directly or indirectly
influence the decision of the City/Police Physician.

SWP Abuse: Requests for sick leave submitted with the intent to deceive shall be
considered fraudulent.

Denial of Time Off: Any employee who has requested and been denied the use of
compensatory time, vacation, or any other accrued leave on a particular day, and who calls in
sick for the day(s) for which leave was denied, shall be required to provide a physician’s
verification of injury or illness.

Member with Break in Service

Any person who reenters City employment shall be credited with any accumulated sick
leave balance remaining at the end of his previous service. (This section covers all cases of
reemployment, including persons who reenter City service by recall, reinstatement or new
examination. No credit is given if the employee was out of service more than one (1) year,
except because of military leave or layoff.)

1. Death in the immediate family - four (4) days will be granted for a death in the
immediate family (husband, wife, parent, parent-in-law, child, brother, sister, grandchild,
grandparent or member of the immediate household). This time off must be used near the death
or burial date. It cannot be deferred to a later time. If more than four days are required, the time
off must be charged to other leaves (vacation, compensatory time, etc.).

2. Death of any other relative - an employee will be entitled to one day to attend the
funeral for the death of any other relative not considered to be in the immediate family. If more
than one day is required, the time off must be charged to other leaves (vacation, compensatory
time, etc.). An employee can use a maximum of five days a calendar year to attend funerals of
relatives not in the immediate family.

Court Appearances

When a sworn member is required to appear in court while on "sick with pay" status, he
will be compensated in the normal manner with pay and/or compensatory time for the court
appearance.

He will be compensated in the normal manner for attending court prior to being called off
sick. For example, if a sworn member attends court from 0900 to 1100 and then becomes ill and
is unable to report for his schedule tour of duty beginning at 2000, he will still receive normal
compensation for the morning court appearance.

This policy will not affect officers on “injured with pay" status since they receive full pay
with no loss of previously accumulated sick time.

Sick With Pay Reciprocity

All members shall have the option to convert to cash up to eighty (80) hours of
accumulated sick leave annually. The conversion shall be at the rate of one (1) hours pay for two
(2) hours of accumulated sick leave.

This benefit shall not be available unless the member has a sick leave balance of at least
eight hundred (800) hours at the end of the last pay period in the previous payroll year and has
used no more than twenty-four (24) hours of sick leave in that same previous payroll year. Sick
leave time used for attendance at a funeral for the death of a member's family shall not be
counted in computing the 24 hour annual limit of sick leave to qualify for the conversion of
accumulated sick leave to pay.

The first payment of this benefit shall be based upon the 1982 payroll year and shall be
made in a lump sum, by a separate check during the second pay period in February of each year,
beginning in 1983, and annually thereafter.

Any eligible member desiring to make such conversion of accumulated sick leave to cash
must notify his supervisor of the total number of hours he desires to convert, on or before January
15 of the year in which the payment is to be made. Conversion will be at the member's hourly
rate of pay in effect during the last pay period of the previous payroll year. (Example: Payments
to be made in February, 1983 shall be based upon the member's hourly rate of pay in effect
during the last pay period of the 1982 payroll year).

All hours of sick leave converted by virtue of this provision shall be deducted from the
member's sick leave balance. All unused or unconverted sick leave shall continue to accumulate.
No prorated payments or conversion will be granted to members leaving city service during the
benefit year (previous payroll year).

additional Cincinnati Police Training Allowance in the amount equal to two percent (2%) of the
top step of the annual salary rate of the member’s current rank or grade. Effective May 3, 2009,
the two percent (2%) training allowance shall be included in the City’s hourly rate calculations.
Additionally, the payment will be included in all reports made to the Ohio Police and Firemen’s
Pension Fund relating to the officer’s earnings. Upon inclusion of the Training Allowance in the
City’s hourly rate calculations, this Section 34 shall be void.

Section 35. Promotions

Effective December 14, 2008, any vacancy in the grade of Specialist shall be filled, within thirty
(30) days, from the existing civil service promotional eligible list at the grade of Specialist in
effect at the time the vacancy is created, with the person in the first position on the eligibility list.
If no civil service promotional eligible list is in effect at such time, the City shall request that the
Civil Service Commission administer a promotional examination for the grade of Police
Specialist pursuant to state civil service laws. Upon posting of the resulting eligible list, the
vacancy shall be filled within thirty (30) days from that list, with the person in the first position
on the eligibility list. Any vacancies existing as of December 14, 2008, shall be filled in
accordance with the provisions of this article.

Section 36. Working Out of Rank

Effective October 26, 2014, all sworn members, with the exception of those holding the rank of
Assistant Police Chief, shall receive an annual Working Out of Rank benefit in an amount equal
to one percent (1%) the member’s current annual salary for his/her current rank, to be paid bi-
weekly throughout the year. The one percent (1%) working out of rank benefit shall not be
included in the City’s hourly rate calculations. However, the payment will be included in all
reports made to the Ohio Police and Firemen’s Disability and Pension Fund relating to the
officer’s earnings. Both the City and the FOP agree that this provision is intended to have no
FLSA implication.

ARTICLE VII

Publication of Assignment
Availability and Transfers

Section 1. Publication of Assignment Availability

When a new assignment or vacancy in an existing assigned area becomes available by
reason of promotion, retirement, resignation, or transfer, notice of such assignment availability
shall be forwarded to all units within ten (10) days of creation of the new assignment or vacancy
and conspicuously posted. All such notices will contain a complete description of the position to
be filled, including duties, working hours, any special qualifications that may be desired but not
required, the name and rank of the immediate supervisor, location where employee will be
required to report and work. All personnel who feel that they qualify for the assignment or
vacancy are encouraged to submit a request to be considered for transfer to the new assignment
or vacant position. Notice of vacancies shall be read at roll call for three (3) consecutive days
and posted in all units for seven (7) days prior to filling the position.

The Police Chief will consider personal qualifications and competence of the applicants
in making a selection.

Nothing in this provision shall in any way control the right of the Police Chief to make a
change in assignment or to temporarily fill a vacancy; it is intended to provide a standardized
method to be utilized prior to permanently filling a vacancy.

Section 2. Notice of Transfer

All members shall be given a minimum of ten (10) calendar days notice of any
involuntary transfer, unless specific extenuating circumstances require less than ten (10) calendar
days notice. In such event, a written explanation detailing the specific extenuating circumstances
shall be provided to the FOP and the affected member prior to the transfer. The City shall not
temporarily change (detail) a member’s assignment to circumvent this provision.

ARTICLE IX
Outside Employment

While Civil Service Regulations dictate regulation of off-duty employment, the
mechanics of the procedure are actually dictated by the Police Department. The two basic types
of employment are in the categories of (1) extension of police service and (2) non-police related
employment.

In the case of extension of police service employment, the employer hires not the
individual, but the uniform, badge, gun and authority of the officer. This activity must remain
closely regulated.

Non-police service type employment will be permitted but must be reported in
accordance with Civil Service Rule XVII. There are particular types of employment which
generates a high potential for the police officer to abuse or to reflect an abuse of his official
position which, in turn, could give rise to illegal or unethical practices.

Prohibition against employment in the following capacities are mandated:

1. Any type of work for a liquor permit premises where alcoholic beverage is sold by
the glass.
2. Employment by, or interest in, any vending machine company or service. (This

shall not prohibit any person from purchasing, renting or leasing vending
machines for use in his private, off-duty employment.)

3. Employment by credit agencies for the purpose of investigating or collecting
accounts, including repossession of automobiles and collection of bad checks.

4. Pre-employment investigations for private industry.

5. Any type of work related to bail bonding.

While this list is not all inclusive, a general rule of thumb regarding prohibitions would
be employment in any capacity which harbored the potential to cause conflict of interest or bring
discredit upon the officer and/or the Police Department.

In no instance shall any disciplinary proceeding or action be grounds for rejection or
cancellation of any outside employment permit unless said outside employment is the subject
matter of the disciplinary proceeding or action.

If an employee is refused an outside employment permit for the reason that it is adverse

to, or in conflict with his municipal employment, it may be submitted immediately to a Step
Three Grievance.

40
Non-Supervisors

The City agrees to discontinue the current practice of charging officers an off-duty detail
fee and agrees not to reinstitute any detail fee to the officers during the term of this agreement.
The FOP agrees that the Police Chief has the sole discretion to establish the off-duty detail rate
that is charged to vendors and shall not challenge any future attempt by the City to impose an off-
duty detail fee to vendors.

ARTICLE X
Police Officer's Rights in
Disciplinary Investigations

When a sworn member of the Cincinnati Police Department has been the subject of an
investigation which results in a disciplinary hearing, he or his designated representative shall
have the right to obtain a copy of any written statement he has made or any recorded statement he
has given, which are to be used in the disciplinary hearing, provided he or his representative
makes a written request for such copy prior to the hearing. The officer and his designated
representative shall be provided a reasonable time after receiving the above items, to review the
materials prior to the disciplinary hearing.

Members who are subject of the investigation will be informed prior to their questioning
that they have the right to have legal counsel or a personal representative present during the
questioning. Reasonable time will be granted to the member to allow him/her to have legal
counsel or a personal representative of his/her choice present during the questioning.

In any interrogation conducted by the Police Department Internal Investigation Section or
similar Police Department unit, a member shall have the right to tape record his entire
interrogation, including comments prior to and following the actual questioning. The
interrogation shall not be unreasonably delayed because of the request for a tape recording.

The FOP shall be permitted to provide and store a tape recorder and tapes in the Internal
Investigation Section for the use of any member who is being interrogated, or the member may
provide his own recorder and tapes. The FOP recorder and tapes shall not be utilized for any
other purpose, and shall be exclusive property of the FOP.

In the event the FOP tape recorder fails to work and the City makes its own recording, the
City will make the original recording available to the member or his designated representative to
copy, but will not provide a copy.

Employees shall be treated with dignity and respect.

in accordance with law.

B. Members shall be allowed to examine the original and all copies of their personnel
service record in the presence of a supervisor, upon the member's request within a reasonable

record which have any relationship to disciplinary matters and shall initial any such entries.

Section 2. Period of Limitations

Records maintained by the Police Department, or any other City agency or department
which allege misconduct or other breach of discipline, for a period of more than three (3) years
from the date of the alleged misconduct or breach of discipline or division knowledge of such
misconduct or breach of discipline shall not be used to support any disciplinary action or charge
of misconduct brought against a sworn member of the Police Department after the expiration of
said three (3) year period. This provision shall not apply to the City's use of entries or copies of
prior disciplinary actions which have been placed in an employee's personnel service records,
unless such entries or copies have been or should have been expunged pursuant to any other
provisions of this Article XI of the Labor Agreement.

Abolishment of Promoted Positions

Section 1. Section 124.37 Abolishment Retained

The City Manager shall retain the authority to abolish any promoted positions in the
Police Department in accord with Section 124.37 of the Revised Code or any successor statute.
This authority shall not be limited in any manner by the terms of Section 2 hereof.

Section 2. Additional Abolishment of Authority

In addition to the authority to abolish promoted positions in accord with Section 124.37
of the Revised Code, the City Manager shall also have authority to abolish such positions in
accord with this Section.

When no eligible list exists for a specific promoted rank in the Police Department, the
City Manager may, after notifying City Council, establish and set the maximum number of
authorized positions at that rank and may set a level higher or lower than the then current number
of positions at that rank, An increase or decrease in the number of authorized positions at that
promoted rank shall become effective when notice of such action by the City Manager is sent by
registered mail to the FOP. A copy of such notice shall also be sent to the Civil Service
Commission, the Assistant or Deputy City Manager and the Police Chief. No current employee
in the affected rank shal! be subject to layoff or demotion solely for the purpose of reaching the
newly established number of authorized positions; such reductions shall be accomplished only
through attrition (resignation, retirement, promotion, demotion or dismissal for cause or death).
The City Manager shall have discretionary authority to abolish such positions as they become
vacant for any managerial reason including, without limitation, lack of work, lack of funds,
efficiency or a reorganization for the delivery of police service at lower cost. The City Manager
may set the number of authorized positions at any time within 10 business days following the
expiration of the eligible list for the subject rank. If no reduction in the number of authorized
positions is set within the 10 business day period, then a promotional examination shall be given
within 60 days thereafter and otherwise in accord with Section 124.44 of the Revised Code.

When the reduced level of authorized positions previously set by the Manager for any
promoted rank is reached, the next vacancy at that rank shall be subject to the examination
requirements specified by state law. During the term of the promotion eligible list generated by
such examination the previously set level of authorized positions for that rank shall not be
decreased except in accord with Section 124.37 of the Revised Code provided in Section 1.

 

48
Non-Supervisors

The abolishment of any promoted positions pursuant to this Section shall be solely in
accord with the terms of this Section and any conflicting provisions of state law including,
without limitation, Section 124.37 of the Revised Code, shall not apply to such abolishments. A
vacancy for promotion or examination purposes shall not exist in the affected rank until such
time as the total number of persons holding that rank falls one below the number of authorized
positions previously set. A position that becomes vacant need not be filled prior to the
abolishment of that position pursuant to this Section and whether or not related demotions or
layoffs at any lower rank are required shall be determined solely within the discretion of the City
Manager. The validity of any abolishment pursuant to this Section shall not be related in any
manner to lower rank demotions or layoffs.

Abolishments pursuant to this Section may be appealed only by the FOP to the Civil
Service Commission pursuant to the review authority of Section 124.03 of the Revised Code
provided that such an appeal may be taken only on behalf of the FOP membership as a group and
may not be taken for the purpose of considering the individual complaints of one or more
members. The scope of such an appeal shall be limited to the issue of the existence of an abuse
of discretion by the City Manager in the abolishment of promoted positions that would directly
and substantially impair the safety of Police Department members. This paragraph shall provide
the exclusive remedy for a claimed violation of this Section and the grievance procedure shall not
apply to such claim.

ARTICLE XXI
Layoff Provision

The City shall be required to provide the Union President a minimum of thirty (30)

APPENDIX B GRIEVANCE MEDIATION PROCEDURES

In recognition of the desirability of resolving disputes by mutual agreement, the FOP and

the City of Cincinnati, hereinafter referred to as the “parties,” mutually agree to the following
policies and procedures for the mediation of grievances pending arbitration, pursuant to the
provisions of Article IIJ of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.

1.

2.

Grievance mediation is available to the parties after Step Five of the grievance procedure.

A grievance will be referred to mediation if the parties mutually agree to mediate a
particular grievance.

The parties shall mutually agree to a mediator to serve in the capacity of grievance
mediator. The mediator must be an experienced mediator and/or arbitrator with
mediation skills. The mediator may serve as an arbitrator for the same issue for which he
or she is a mediator only with the agreement of both parties.

The mediator will be asked to provide a schedule of available dates. Cases will be
scheduled in a manner which assures that the mediator will be able to handle multiple
cases on each date, unless otherwise mutually agreed.

The grievant shall be represented by the FOP and shall have the right to be present at the
mediation conference. The City and the Union may each have no more than three (3)
representatives (not counting the grievant) as participants in the mediation effort. Neither
party shall be represented by an attorney. On the day of the mediation, persons
representing the parties shall be vested that day with full authority to resolve the issues
being considered.

The mediator may employ all of the techniques commonly associated with mediation,
including private caucuses with the parties. The taking of oaths and the examination of
witnesses shall not be permitted, and no verbatim record of the proceeding shall be taken.
The purpose of the mediation effort is to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of the
dispute. There will be no procedural constraints regarding the review of facts and
arguments. There shall be no formal evidence rules. Written materials presented to the
mediator will be returned to the party presenting them at the conclusion of the mediation
conference.

Mediation efforts will be informal in nature and shall not include written opinions or
recommendations from the mediator unless mutually agreed to by the parties and the
mediator. In the event that a grievance which has been mediated is appealed to
arbitration, there shall be no reference in the arbitration proceeding to the fact that a
mediation conference was or was not held. Nothing said or done by the mediator may be
referenced or introduced into evidence at the arbitration hearing.

31
 

Non-Supervisors

At the mediation conference the mediator shall first seek to assist the parties in reaching a
mutually satisfactory settlement of the grievance which is within the parameters of the
collective bargaining agreement. If a settlement is reached, a settlement agreement will
be entered into in writing at the mediation conference. The mediator shall not have the
authority to compel the resolution of a grievance.

If a grievance remains unresolved at the end of the mediation conference the mediator
may, if requested by either party, render a verbal opinion as to how the grievance is likely
to be decided if it is presented at arbitration. This opinion is non-binding and
inadmissible in any subsequent arbitration proceeding.

If a settlement is not reached, the matter shall go forward to the arbitration step. All
applicable time limits for appealing a grievance to arbitration contained in the collective
bargaining agreement shall commence on the day of the mediation conference.

The dates, times and places of mediation conferences will be determined by mutual
agreement of the parties. Each party shall designate a representative responsible for
scheduling mediation conferences.

The parties agree to schedule a minimum of one day a month, if necessary, for mediation
efforts during the time period of this agreement.

The fees and expenses to be charged by the mediator shall be negotiated between him or
her and the parties. Fees and expenses for grievance mediation shall be paid equally by
the City and the Union.

The parties agree to schedule a day of orientation and training to be attended by those
individuals who will be participating in the mediation proceedings on behalf of the
parties.

The parties agree to mutually examine and review the grievance mediation process and
procedures adopted herein twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the
collective bargaining agreement. The purpose of said examination and review is to
revise, alter, correct or otherwise improve the grievance mediation process and
procedures if such is deemed necessary.

APPENDIX D

TUITION REIMBURSEMENT

A full-time (at least 3/4 time) permanent or provisional employee is eligible for tuition
reimbursement for up to six credit hours per academic session at the rate of: 100% for A, 80%
for B, 60% for C (plus and minus grades have no effect on the reimbursement received by the
employee). In courses that are graded on pass/fail basis, 80% tuition reimbursement will be
granted for a passing grade and 0% reimbursement for a failing grade provided that:

1.

2.

The employee has completed his probationary period before the course begins.

The education or training is obtained from an approved, and accredited college,
university, secondary school, technical institute, business institute or other institute or
school during non-working hours. An agency may allow courses to be taken during work
hours provided vacation or compensatory time is used.

The course is job related or related to the employee’s current position or to his future city
development and promotion.

Request for reimbursement is filed before course registration using the designated form.
The reimbursement is only for tuition expenses. Lab fees, etc. are not reimbursable.
Funds from the agency’s budget must be available.

Final determination regarding course relatedness or accreditability shall be made by the
Director of Human Resources before the request for reimbursement is approved by the
department director.

A receipt of tuition payment and a grade report is submitted within 30 days after the
academic session ends. A grade of at least “C” or equivalent must be achieved in each
course.

In case of a full-time employee who is also a full-time student paying a flat rate, the
amount to be reimbursed will be determined by dividing the number of hours taken into
the tuition or instructional fee (not including any general or special fees) to get the
employee’s cost per credit hour which will be reimbursed based on the aforementioned
ABC scale.
