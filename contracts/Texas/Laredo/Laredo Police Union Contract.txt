alcoholism or drug-related problems will not be considered as being eligible
for Serious Illness Leave.

(A)

(B)

(C)

25.4 Steps.

(A)

Any member who is aggrieved shall notify the Association giving the nature and
details of the incident which led to his grievance. The grievance report form
agreed to by the Chief and the Association is to be used for submitting any
grievance, The grievance must be submitted within ten (10) business days of the
date upon which the member knew of or should have known of the occurrence
giving rise to the grievance.

A grievance not brought to the attention of the Association within the time limit
prescribed shall not be considered timely and shall be void.

The time limitations described herein may be waived by mutual agreement in
writing by the Association and the City Manager or his designee.

Step 1: Any aggrieved member shall submit his grievance in writing within the
time limitations specified above to the Association. Within ten (10) business days
of receipt of the grievance, the Association Grievance Committee shall determine
if a valid grievance exists. If in the opinion of the majority of the members of the
committee, no grievance exists, the Committee shall notify the member and no
further action shall be taken. The Committee agrees that it will consult with
representatives of CLEAT concerning the validity of grievances in making the
decision to pursue a grievance, However, nothing herein shall take away from the

45
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

authority of the Association to pursue any Committee approved grievance filed by
an Officer it deems to be a violation of the contract. All grievances shall be styled
in the name of the Officer(s) filing a grievance.

The Association shall judge each grievance in a fair and equitable manner. In its
sole discretion, the Association shall determine whether the grievance is valid or
not. The Association may modify, revise, or amend the grievance if necessary to
properly place the dispute in issue for resolution. Only the Association has
standing to initiate, pursue or settle a grievance under the terms of this
Agreement.

Step 2: If, in the opinion of the majority of the members of the Committee, a
grievance does exist, the Association shall, with or without the physical presence
of the aggrieved member, present the grievance in writing to the Chief of Police
for adjustment.

A grievance presented to the Chief of Police by the Association on or after the
twenty first (21st) business day, shall not be considered to have been timely filed
and shall be void without requirement to address the merits of the grievance.

For purposes of calculating this Step, the Chief shall have ten (10) business days
to respond in writing to the grievance.

Step 3: If the grievance has not been settled at Step 2, the Association shall submit
it to the City Manager for adjustment within ten (10) business days after receipt of
the Chiefs written response.

Grievances may be consolidated for resolution under this Article by the City
Manager.

Failure to timely submit the grievance to the City Manager will render the
grievance void without requirement to address the merits of the grievance.

Step 4: If within twenty (20) business days, the grievance has not been settled, the
Association shall make a written request that the grievance be submitted to
arbitration.

For purposes of calculating this step, the City Manager has fifteen (15) business
days to respond after which the Association has five (5) business days to make
written request of the City Manager that the grievance be submitted to arbitration.
Failure to timely request an arbitration will render the grievance void without
requirement to address the merits of the grievance.

Step 5. At any time after receipt of the grievance by the City Manager, the

attorney for either the Association or the City may request from the other a
meeting to attempt to resolve the grievance. While this is not a mandatory step in

46
the grievance process, the parties agree to utilize this process on grievances that
both parties believe there is a legitimate possibility of resolution through such
meetings.

prohibits the Chief or the department from compelling the Association President
to disclose information regarding the same subject but obtained from a source
other than directly from the employee who was represented or advised.

the interview that he or she believes statements he or she makes may cause him or
her to become a subject of the investigation, the investigator conducting the
interview will not begin the interview or will stop an interview already in progress

53

or not the officer is or will be subject of investigation. If so, then the interview can

32.1, In order to further their joint interest in protecting police officers and the public, the City
and the Association agree to mandatory random drug and alcohol testing described in this
section. All police officers, including the Chief, will be subject to mandatory random drug
testing during each calendar year at the city's expense. The City and the Association are
committed to the principle that the mandatory random drug and alcohol testing policy for
officers, as per Ordinance 2008-O-011, is designed for, and will be administered to result in,
disciplinary action, only against any officer whose random drug and alcohol test reflects a
positive test result and thereby a violation of the City Ordinance and the Police Department's
rules, regulations, policies, or procedures in reference to alcohol use and illegal drug use. For the
purposes of this Article:

“Alcohol” is defined as an intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol or other low
molecular weight alcohols including methyl and isopropyl alcohol.

57
“Alcohol use” is defined as the consumption of any beverage mixture, or preparation, including
any non-prescription medication containing alcohol.

“Alcohol testing” is a test conducted by a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT), or any other Person
approved by the Department of Transportation rules, using an Evidential Breath Testing Device
(EBT) to measure the amount of alcohol concentration in a volume of breath, or any other test
used to detect the presence of alcohol that is approved by the Federal Highway Administration,
(FHWA).

“Drugs” shall be defined as a substance that can cause addiction, a marked change in mental or
physical status, or psychological/physical dependency that could affect job performance; this
may include any illegal drugs, controlled substances, inhalants, or nonprescription drugs with
abuse potential, legally/illegally prescribed drugs. Illegal drugs include prescription drugs
prescribed for someone other than the employee.

"Drug testing" is defined as the compulsory production and submission of urine by an officer for
chemical analysis to detect the presence of prohibited drug usage.

“Medical Review Officer (MRO)”

Evidential Breath Testing Device (EBT) — is a device approved by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and is used for the evidential testing of breath and

Devices”. (40.3) {Note: Approved devices must be capable of printing out each test result and air
blank, and must sequentially number each test.}

“Positive test results” is defined for alcohol, as a breath alcoho! concentration of 0.02 grams and
above is considered a positive test result for DOT and non-DOT. For those employees who are
under EAP (Employee Assistance Program) guidelines, any alcohol concentration level of above
zero (0) will be considered positive.

"Random drug testing" will mean the drug testing of individuals selected by the method
described in Section 32.2 of this Article, and under the standards specified in Section 32.3, and
as applicable per the City’s current Drug and Alcohol Ordinance No. 2008-O-011, and any future
addendums.

"Reasonable suspicion" shall mean a belief based on objective facts and observable on-duty
behavior, speech, or body odors sufficient to suspect that an employee is under the influence of
drugs or alcohol so that the employee's ability to perform the functions of the job is impaired or
so that the employee's ability to perform his job safely is reduced; a belief that the employee has
violated the drug, alcohol, and/or inhalant prohibitions, based on specific, contemporaneous,
articulate observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the
employee,

“Refusal to submit (to a drug or alcohol test)” is defined as an employee who (1) fails to provide
adequate breath for testing without a valid medical explanation after he has received notice of the

58
requirement for breath testing, (2) fails to provide adequate urine for drug testing without a valid
medical explanation after he has received notice of the requirement for urine testing, or (3)
engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process, is in violation of the policy and will
be considered a positive result.

32.2. The City will require random testing under the following conditions:

(A)

(B)

A fair and impartial statistical basis (on which each officer only identified by their
employee number, of all ranks including the Chief, has an equal chance of being
selected during each random test during any calendar year) shall be by a non-
discriminatory computerized program operated and certified as non-
discriminatory by an independent Certified Collecting Facility hired by the City,
and the officer shall be tested, for both drugs and alcohol, upon being selected by
the computerized program.

tested within 72 hours by another certified laboratory.

Drug testing shall consist of an initial gas chromatography screening test and if
positive a confirmation of the split specimen test by another certified laboratory.

EXHIBIT A
SERIOUS ILLNESS LEAVE

Revised Policy for Requesting and Granting Leave under the Collective Bargaining Agreement
Established April 14, 1997 and amended 2008

A. Authority

This policy is being implemented under the authority of the Collective Bargaining Agreement
between, the City of Laredo, Texas and the Laredo Police Officers' Association. Article 17,
Section 3(B), wherein it states that the employer shall follow this Exhibit A, as to requesting and
granting use of the Serious Illness Leave,

B. Requirements

In accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Article17, Section 3 (B) (4), leave
days may not be used for injuries or illnesses sustained in the line of duty.

No leave of absence, for the purpose of Serious Illness Leave in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement, Article 17, Section 3 (B)(3), may exceed 1,440 hours for a single illness or injury.

(NOTE: In the event that there are any Police Officers currently using the Serious Illness Leave,
as of the date of this Policy's implementation, they will be eligible under the provisions of this
revised policy for the unused balance of Serious Illness Leave hours not to exceed 1,440 hours,

C. Procedure

1, Requests for a leave of absence to be charged against the Collective Bargaining
Agreement's Serious Illness Leave must be submitted in writing to the Chief of Police.
The City of Laredo Police Department Request and Authorization for Leave form must
be used. The written request must include:

a. Qualifying condition” the claim is being made under; and

b, Number of years of service to determine eligibility to draw from the Serious Illness
Leave (Article 17, Section 3); and

c. Medical leave authorized by physician (start date and end date); and

d. Off the job location where the injury or illness occurred; and

e. Date the injury or illness occurred.

‘The request must be initially reviewed by the Chief of Police, The request should be made within
five (5) business days of the date that the serious illness or injury occurred to avoid delays in
payroll processing,

2. The Chief of Police will forward the request to the Employee Health Nurse. The
Employee Health Nurse will request that the employee submit a copy of the

63
diagnosis/prognosis and the Employee Health Nurse will determine, based on the
diagnosis/prognosis, whether a serious illness or injury under the Collective Bargaining
Agreement exists. All medical records pertaining to the particular illness or injury will be
received, reviewed and stored with the strictest of confidentiality by the Employee Health
Nurse.

. The immediate supervisor will indicate the employee's physical job requirements
required in the performance of his/her duties on the City's Physical Job Requirements
form which will serve as the equivalent of a fitness for duty report. The employee will
take the Physical Job Requirements form that has been completed by the immediate
supervisor to his/her treating physician(s). The employee's treating physician(s) will
indicate which physical job requirements may be performed by the individual. This report
is intended to assist the treating physician(s) in determining whether the employee can
perform the essential functions of the job.

. The treating physician(s) decides if the individual can do modified/alternate duty. Based
on the treating physician's determination on the Physical Job Requirements form, and the
employee's diagnosis/prognosis, the treating physician will recommend the number of
days that the employee must be out before being physically able to return to work for
modified/alternate duty. Any pre-existing condition will be taken into consideration by
the treating physician(s). The treating physician(s) shall certify in writing that an
individual will be out for a specific number of days until he/she can return to
modified/alternate duty.

. The employee will submit the treating physician's recommendation to the Employee
Health Nurse. If the treating physician took into consideration any pre-existing
conditions, those conditions must be identified on the written recommendation, and any
necessary supporting documentation must be submitted to the Employee Health Nurse.
The Employee Health Nurse will compare the treating physician's recommendations with
the Official Disability Guidelines and the Medical Disability Advisor, both approved by
the Association of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which contain disability
guidelines for the same or similar illnesses or injuries. The Employee Health Nurse will
take into consideration any pre-existing conditions identified by the employee's treating
physician(s).

. If the treating physician's recommendation is within the range accepted by the disability
guidelines for the illness or injury, taking into consideration any pre-existing conditions,
then the days recommended by the treating physician will be granted. However, no
officer shall be permitted to use more than 1,440 hours for a single illness or injury.
(Article 17, Section 3 (B) (3) ).

. If the treating physician's recommendation exceeds the accepted range published in the
disability guidelines, the Employee Health Nurse will contact the employee and request
that the employee sign a medical authorization release. After having made this inquiry,
the Employee Health Nurse will review with the City's designated Physician the treating
physician's recommendation or the maximum number of days published in the disability
guidelines. If the designated City's physician does not accept the treating physician's
recommendation, the employee will be notified and may request a second medical
opinion.

The employee may request a second medical opinion at the employee's expense in
accordance with the City of Laredo medical benefits program. If a second physician's
opinion is requested and submitted by the employee, the designated City's physician may
accept the medical opinion that more closely approximates the disability guidelines, or
the maximum number of days published in the disability guidelines, subject to the
discretion of the Group Benefits Administrator to request a third medical opinion.

If, at the discretion of the Group Benefits Administrator, a third opinion is necessary, that
third opinion will be paid for by the Group Benefits Administrator. However, if the
employee (covered person) wants a third opinion, it will be subject to the deductible and
co-payment percentage. No officer shall be permitted to use more than 1,440 hours for a
single illness or injury,

The Human Resources Director will provide the Chief of Police and the LPOA president
with a copy of the form authorizing/not authorizing the granting of days from the serious
illness leave. The Laredo Police Department personnel/payroll division shall monitor the
minimum balance of the existing pool hours until exhausted and provide monthly reports
to the Chief of Police and the LPOA president. The Laredo Police Department
personnel/payroll division will provide a report to the Chief of Police and the LPOA
president documenting the number of hours remaining in the pool until exhausted after
each request that is approved by the Employee Health Nurse.
