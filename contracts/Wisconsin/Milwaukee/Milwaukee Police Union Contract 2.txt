Re: Discretionary Days Off in Lieu of Discipline

Overview

The current disciplinary system within the Milwaukee Police Department frequently results in
varying periods of unpaid suspension leave for employees. In essence employees are found
guilty of violations of departmental rules and regulations and the Chief of Police Head makes a
determination as to appropriate penalty. Upon Order of the Chief of Police, employees may be
subjected to periods of unpaid suspension of one or more days in length. In such events the
disciplined member is suspended for specific date(s) as determined by the Professional
Performance Division, and said member suffers a financial loss for the unpaid date(s). It is
recognized that financial losses are not typically borne by the offending member alone, but by
his or her family as well. Additionally, members on paid suspension periods are absent from
duty and therefore the Police Department suffers the loss of human resources. It is the intent of
this agreement to provide for a suitable alternative to the current system, which will alleviate
much of the financial loss to employees and their families, keep productive employees at their
workplaces and still provide an effective means of discipline. This shall be accomplished by
allowing Police Department members, under the below conditions, to substitute discretionary off

time in place of suspension days.

Procedure

In those discipline cases wherein the Chief of Police orders the suspension of a member for a
period of five days or less, the member subject to said discipline shall be served with the
discipline order(s) consistent with current practices. In addition, the member shall also be served
with a notice informing them of their option to substitute discretionary time in place of any or all
suspension days. The notice shall advise the member that if he or she wishes to substitute

206
CamordtanekwWnN ee

WwW WwW Ww YHYNYNNNNNNY SR See ee eee
ABRONFSTOAAAARKHNHKF SOMA AIADAUNUKRYWNHRE SDS

discretionary time, he or she must notify the Personnel Division in writing within five calendar

days. Upon proper notification, the Personnel Division shall process the member’s request and

subtract the appropriate discretionary time from the member’s balance. Failure to properly

notify the Personnel Division or Administrator within the five-day period shall automatically

result in the member forfeiting their ability to substitute discretionary time and the suspension

shall proceed as ordered by the Chief.

Conditions of Agreement

For applicable suspension as described above, the substitution of discretionary time shall

be at the member’s sole discretion, given that the member has the time available.

Suspensions exceeding five days shall not be eligible for substitution.

Only vacation days may be substituted. Substitutions shall be on a one-for-one basis, i.e.

one vacation day replaces one suspension day.

Compensatory time, sick time, etc., may not be utilized for substitution.

Members may choose to substitute discretionary time for all or part of a suspension

period. However, substitutions may only be made in full eight-hour blocks.

Members may only substitute discretionary time that is available on the current Time

Owed and Allowed reports. Members may not “borrow” future time.

In the event that a member chooses not to substitute discretionary time, or does not have

the time available to them on the current Time Owed and Allowed report, said member

shall serve the suspension days as ordered by the Chief.

A member’s decision to substitute discretionary time shall have no bearing on their

disciplinary record. All official Police Department disciplinary records, including the

Personnel Order, shall continue to indicate that the member was suspended for the time

period as ordered. Substituted suspension time shall continue to be a factor in matters

such as progressive discipline, Sick Leave Incentive, promotional exams, etc.

A member’s decision to substitute discretionary time is neither an admission of guilt nor

a waiver of grievance/appeal rights.

In the event that a member chooses to substitute discretionary time and then is awarded a

reduction of discipline through the grievance/appeal process, said member shall be

credited with the awarded day(s), to the same account from which they were drawn.

Time credited to the member’s balance shall be governed by the rules in place for

discretionary time applicable to the date the time is returned. For example: In January of

2005, a member is suspended for two days and substitutes two vacation days. The

member grieves the discipline and in January of 2006, an arbitrator reduces the discipline
207
 

1 to one day. The Police Department would then add eight hours to the member’s vacation
2 balance for year 2006 and subsequently the eight hours would have to be utilized by the
3 end of that calendar year, unless the arbitrator/umpire directs otherwise.
4 e For purposes of this memorandum of understanding, the parties recognize the authority of
5 the arbitrator/umpire to direct that the member be able to utilize any returned time during
6 a period of one year immediately following the date of the award.
7 e The Chief of Police shall not in any way consider a member’s discretionary off-time
8 balance when deciding upon discipline.
9 e The procedure would be implemented on a trial basis for the term of the 2007-2009

10 Agreement and could be extended beyond that date by mutual agreement.
