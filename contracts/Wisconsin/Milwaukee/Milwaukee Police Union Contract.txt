now expressly provided for respectively either by: State Statute and Charter Ordinances
of the City of Milwaukee except as expressly limited herein.

6. It is intended by the parties hereto that the employer-employee relationship which exists

I. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

A. GRIEVANCES

1.

Differences involving the interpretation, application or enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement or the application of a rule or regulation of the
Milwaukee Police Department affecting wages, hours, or conditions of
employment shall constitute a grievance under the provisions set forth
below. Matters of departmental discipline involving application of the rules
or regulations of the Milwaukee Police Department which are not subject to
appeal to the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, shall constitute a
grievance under the aforementioned provisions and matters of departmental
discipline involving application of the rules or regulations of the Chief of
Police which are subject to appeal to the Board of Fire and Police
Commissioners shall not constitute a grievance under the aforementioned
provisions. Matters involving approval of medical (or dental) insurance
claims filed by an employee, or medical (or dental) insurance claims filed
by an employee on behalf of his/her dependents, shall not constitute a
grievance under the aforementioned provisions.

Obligations of the City under Chapter 65, Wisconsin Statutes, and any
pension matter under the exclusive jurisdiction or control of any duly
constituted pension board shall not constitute a grievance under the
provisions aforementioned.

Grievances over discipline shall be initiated at the level of the Grievance
Procedure immediately above the level of the chain of command at which
the discipline was administered, except that in cases of discipline

administered by the Chief of Police the grievance shall be initiated at step 2

of the Grievance Procedure and be reviewed by the Chief of Police.

Steps 1 and 2, inclusive, of this Grievance Procedure shall be inapplicable
to grievances involving health and life insurance benefits. A grievance
concerning health insurance or life insurance benefits, other than a matter
involving claims, shall be submitted directly to the City Labor Negotiator
for review within fifteen (15) calendar days of the occurrence of the
incident leading to such grievance. Within fifteen (15) calendar days
following receipt of such grievance by the City Labor Negotiator,
representatives of the MPA shall meet with the City Labor Negotiator, or
his/her designee, at a mutually convenient time and place in an attempt to
resolve the grievance. Following such meeting, the City Labor Negotiator
shall answer the grievance in writing setting forth the reasons for his/her
decision and submit same to the Association Grievance Committee
Chairman within twenty-five (25) calendar days of such meeting. If the
grievance is not settled, the Association may proceed to final and binding
arbitration as hereinafter provided.

All grievances and grievance appeals shall set forth the provision of the
Agreement and/or the rule or regulation of the Chief of Police under which
the grievance was filed. All appeals of duly filed grievances not submitted
by the Association or employee (hereinafter referred to as "member")
within the time limit specified shall be termed abandoned grievances and as
such shall be considered as being resolved in favor of the City and not
subject to provisions of this GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
PROCEDURE. By mutual agreement, the parties may waive any of the
steps contained in this GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
PROCEDURE. With the consent of the Association, the City Labor

Negotiator may waive any of the steps contained in this GRIEVANCE

B.

AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE for grievances involving economic
matters; this waiver provision shall not apply to grievances over matters of
Departmental discipline.

In the event the Chief or Department takes a particular action which, in the
Association's view, results in a violation of the agreement and such action
adversely affects a number of members under circumstances that are
essentially identical, the MPA grievance committee may file a group
grievance on their behalf at the second step, within 15 calendar days of the
occurrence of the incident leading to such grievance. The group grievance
shall identify by name, all members alleged to have been adversely affected
by such action. If the MPA grievance committee is unable to identify all
members of the group, by name, within the time limit allowed for the filing
of grievances, it shall specify those facts which cause the adversely affected
members to be identically situated in its view. Before responding to the
grievance, the Department shall provide the Association with information
or access to information reasonably necessary for the Association to
identify the members covered by the group grievance. The Association
must identify all members covered by the group grievance before appealing
it to arbitration. Alleged violations occurring after the occurrence of the
incident giving rise to the group grievance shall not be considered to be
covered by the group grievance, even if the facts are alleged to be
essentially identical. In such a case, separate grievances or group
grievances must be timely filed in order to be considered. Nothing herein is
intended to preclude the parties from agreeing to consolidate grievances and

group grievances for purposes of arbitration.

STEPS IN THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
STEP 1:

10
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

The aggrieved member shall reduce his/her grievance to writing on a
provided numbered form and shall present such written grievance to his/her
Association Steward. The Association Steward shall meet with the grievant
and if the grievant so desires and the Association Steward so determines,
the Association Steward shall present the written grievance to the grievant's
district or bureau commanding officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of
the occurrence of the incident leading to the grievance. Thereafter, the
grievant, his/her Association Steward and his/her district or bureau
commanding officer together with the grievant's immediate supervisor shall
meet and discuss the grievance in a friendly manner and shall make every
effort to resolve the grievance. The district or bureau commanding officer,
if he/she deems it appropriate, may also discuss the grievance with the
grievant's shift commander and may include him/her in the meeting.
Following said meeting, the district or bureau commanding officer in
consultation with the grievant's shift commander and immediate supervisor
shall answer the grievance in writing, setting forth the reasons for his
decision and submit same to the Association Steward and the aggrieved

within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance.

STEP 2

If the grievance is not resolved in step 1 above, the MPA Grievance
Committee Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the
MPA bargaining unit, may within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt
of the Step 1 decision appeal this decision to the Chief of Police. Failure to
appeal said decision within said period of time shall constitute a settlement
of the grievance. Said appeal shall be in writing and shall be submitted to
the Chief of Police and therein a request shall be made for a meeting with

the Chief of Police to consider the decision from Step 1. The Chief of

Police and the Chief's Panel together with the MPA Grievance Committee
Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the MPA
bargaining unit, shall meet at a mutually agreeable time. The grievant shall
be entitled to be present at such appeal meeting and shall have the right to
be represented by the Grievance Committee Chairman, or his/her designee
who shall be a member of the MPA bargaining unit, and the parties shall
discuss the Step 1 decision in good faith and attempt to resolve the matter.
Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written appeal to the
grievance, unless the time period is mutually extended by the parties, the
Chief shall, in writing, advise the Chairman of the MPA Grievance
Committee and the grievant as to the Chief's decision with respect to the
grievance. If an Association grievance is not settled at the second step, the
Association may proceed to final and binding arbitration as hereinafter

provided.

Il. GRIEVANCE ARBITRATION

A.

Final and binding arbitration may be initiated by serving upon the Chief of Police
and City Labor Negotiator a notice in writing of an intent to proceed to final and
binding arbitration within 30 calendar days of receipt of the second step answer.

Said notice shall identify the grievance and the employees involved.

Unless the parties can, within seven (7) calendar days following the receipt of such
written notice, agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, either party may in writing
request the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission to submit a list of five
(5) arbitrators to both parties. The parties shall, within seven (7) calendar days of
the receipt of said list, select the arbitrator by alternately striking names from the
list until one name remains. Such person shall then become the arbitrator.

The arbitrator shall hold hearings at a time convenient to the parties, with the

12
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

location of such hearings alternating between the MPA offices and the offices of
the City Hall complex. The arbitrator shall take such evidence as in his/her
judgment is appropriate for the disposition of the dispute. Statements of position
may be made by the parties and witnesses may be called. In disputes involving
application of rules or regulations of the Milwaukee Police Department, the Chief
of Police or his or her representative shall be permitted to participate in the
proceeding and to state the Department's position on the dispute.

The arbitrator shall neither add to, detract from, nor modify the language of the
Agreement or of the rules and regulations in arriving at a determination of any
issue presented that is proper for final and binding arbitration within the limitations
expressed herein. The arbitrator shall have no authority to grant wage increases or
wage decreases.

The arbitrator shall expressly confine himself/herself to the precise issues
submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to determine any other issue
not so submitted to him/her or to submit observations or declarations of opinion
which are not directly essential in reaching the determination.

In reviewing any difference over application of a departmental rule or regulation
under this grievance and arbitration procedure, the arbitrator shall take into account
the special statutory responsibilities granted to the Chief of Police under Section
62.50, Wisconsin Statutes, 1977. The arbitrator shall not impair the ability of the
Chief of Police to operate the Department in accordance with the Statutory
responsibilities under Section 62.50, Wisconsin Statutes, 1977, nor shall he/she
impair the authority of the Chief of Police to maintain, establish and modify rules
and regulations for the operation of the Police Department, provided such rules and
regulations are not in violation of the specific provisions of this Agreement. In
addition, the arbitrator shall not prohibit the Chief of Police from executing

Departmental rules and regulations in a fair and equitable manner.

G. All expenses which may be involved in the arbitration proceedings shall be borne
by the parties equally. However, the expenses relating to the calling of witnesses
or the obtaining of depositions or any other similar expense associated with such
proceedings shall be borne by the party at whose request such witnesses or
depositions are required.

H. For the purpose of receiving testimony and evidence, the provisions of Section
788.06 and 788.07 of the Wisconsin Statutes shall apply. The arbitration award
shall be reduced to writing and shall be subject to Sections 788.08 through and
including 788.15 of the Wisconsin Statutes. All other sections and provisions of
Chapter 788 are hereby expressly negated and of no force and effect in any
arbitration under this Agreement.

L It is contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement that any arbitration award
shall be issued by the arbitrator within sixty (60) calendar days after the notice of
appointment unless the parties to this Agreement shall extend the period in writing
by mutual consent.

J. The arbitrator shall submit in writing his/her award to the parties.

ARTICLE 8

PROHIBITION OF STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS

1.

The Association pledges itself to make every effort to maintain unimpaired the police
service and protection of the community. It shall not cause, condone, counsel or permit its
members, or any of them, individually or in concert, to strike, slow down, disrupt, impede
or otherwise impair the normal functions of the Department.

Should one or more members of the bargaining unit, during the term of this Contract or
any extension thereof, breach the obligations of Subsection 1, the City Labor Negotiator
shall immediately notify the officers of the Association that a prohibited action is in
progress.

received. Employees entering new classifications during the term of this Agreement,
where the biweekly pay rate of the maximum pay step for the new classification is less
than or equal to the rate of the maximum pay step for the classification the employee
previously occupied, shall continue to be paid at the pay step at which they were paid

full performance of the regularly scheduled hours of work for the given biweekly pay
period in accordance with the HOURS OF WORK provision of this Agreement. When
Jess than the full schedule of hours is worked by an employee during any such biweekly
pay period, the employee's biweekly base salary shall be reduced by an amount equivalent

Except as provided in subsection 3 of this Article, below, each employee covered by this
Agreement at the close of the calendar year who has completed at least ten (10) years of
service but less than fifteen (15) years of service as of that time shall be eligible to receive
$300, each employee covered by this Agreement at the close of the calendar year who has
completed at least fifteen (15) years of service but less than twenty (20) years of service as
of that time shall be eligible to receive $550, and each employee covered by this
Agreement at the close of the calendar year who has completed twenty (20) or more years
of service as of that time shall be eligible to receive $900. An employee's "years of

service," as used herein, shall mean his/her active service as a member of the WERC-
certified bargaining unit represented by the Association or its predecessor, the
Professional Policemen's Protective Association.

Except as provided in subsection 3 of this Article, below, payments earned under these
provisions shall be made as soon as is administratively practicable after December 31.

An employee retiring on normal pension, or resigning voluntarily from the Police
Department shall be entitled to the benefits provided by subsection | of this Article,
above, prorated on the basis of his/her active service in the calendar year he/she retired,
computed to the nearest calendar month. For purposes of prorating, an employee on the
Police Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as
having been on the payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is on the
Police Department payroll less than 14 days in a calendar month, then the employee shall

their Longevity Pay benefits included in final average salary for purposes of computing

their service retirement allowance. For purposes of interpretation and construction of the
provisions of this Article:

a. The Longevity Pay benefit to which the employee is entitled to include in the Final
Average Salary computation shall be an amount equal to the Longevity Pay
payment the employee received for December 31 of the calendar year immediately
preceding the employee's effective date of retirement. For such employees who
retire after December 31, 1997, and who have attained 20 years or more of service
by the end of the calendar year which includes their effective date of retirement,
that amount shall be the longevity pay payment the employee would have received
had he or she remained in active service for the calendar year which includes his or
her effective date of retirement.

b. Employees shall be required to contribute to their respective City pension funds
$1.00 of the Longevity Pay payment they received for that year. The contribution
shall be a payroll deduction made at the time the payment is made.

Employees in active service shall have time spent receiving a duty disability retirement

allowance counted as active service for purposes of computing current and prospective

longevity benefits.

between the City and the Association, shall be entitled to these benefits under the terms

and conditions set forth if the combination of his/her "years of service," as defined in

paragraph 1., hereof, and his/her service in detached status establish eligibility therefore.
8. An employee on a military leave of absence for performance of duty as a member of the

State of Wisconsin National Guard or a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the

United States shall be eligible for Longevity Pay benefits for a calendar year prorated on

the basis of the employee's active service with the Department in that calendar year

subject to the following:

a. The military leave is a result of being called to, or volunteering for, active duty
under the authority granted to the President of the United States or the Congress of
the United States for a period of more than 30 calendar days;

b. The length of service requirements provided in section 1., above, shall determine
the amount of Longevity Pay benefits to which the employee is entitled;

c. Length of service shall be calculated as of the effective date the employee
separated from active service with the Department and began his/her unpaid
military leave of absence.

d. For purposes of prorating Longevity Pay benefits, an employee on the Police
Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as
having been on the payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is
on the Police Department payroll less that 14 days in a calendar month, then the

ARTICLE 14

HOURS OF WORK

1. The normal hours of work for employees covered by this Agreement shall consist of work
shifts of eight (8) consecutive hours which in the aggregate results in an average normal
work week of forty (40) hours.

2. Within the normal hours of work, any shift assignment of eight consecutive hours, which
is of 10 consecutive eight-hour work shifts in duration or longer, with each eight-hour
work shift starting at the same time or in the case of special assignments such as vice-
squad with possible differing starting times for each eight-hour work shift shall be deemed
to be a regularly scheduled eight-hour shift assignment; except that within the normal
hours of work Christmas Store detail or Summerfest detail shall also constitute a regularly

scheduled eight-hour shift assignment. The regularly scheduled eight-hour shift
assignment of employees assigned to the Professional Performance Division (PPD) who
perform duties traditionally performed by PPD, including criminal investigations of
department members and investigations of claims to which the department is a party, shall
be established in the same manner as that of employees assigned to the vice-squad as
stated above.

The regularly scheduled eight-hour shift shall be established by the Chief of Police in
accordance with the requirements set forth above.

Except on those occasions when an emergency situation exists, if the Department desires
to change the off days falling within a single pay period for a member who otherwise
continues to be assigned to the same schedule and off day group, the member must be
given personal notice of such change, at least seven days prior to the start of the pay
period in question. If the Department fails to give such notice, all hours worked on either
of the off days in question shall be treated as falling outside the regularly scheduled eight-

hour shift, as provided in Article 15

ARTICLE 15

OVERTIME

DEFINITION:

Overtime shall be all authorized assignments outside the regularly scheduled eight-hour
shift as hereinbefore defined under the Article “Hours of Work.” Notwithstanding the
fact that trade off of work assignments or other rescheduling of work assignments
authorized by the Department at the request of the employee results in work assignments
outside of the regularly scheduled eight-hour shift, such time shall not be considered

overtime.

The duration of the employee’s court overtime appearance
beginning at the time the employee is required to be in
court, ending at the time the employee is released by the
court and including a reasonable amount of time for the
employee to get to and from his/her parked vehicle. An
employee assigned to the early shift on a regular basis who
receives City-paid parking hereunder as a result of a court
appearance during his/her off-duty hours shall also be
entitled to an extension of such parking until the end of
his/her assignment on that date if he/she is assigned to early
shift duty on that date and the conclusion of the court
appearance falls within two hours of the start of his/her
shift.

present the court overtime time card for that appearance and the
designated parking facility receipt covering the time period of the
appearance to a supervisory police officer designated by the Police
Department Administration. The overtime card shall indicate the
duration of the court appearance. Based on the overtime card, the
designated supervisory officer shall authorize the payment of the
parking fee to cover the time period of the court appearance and a
reasonable amount of time for the employee to get to and from
his/her vehicle and the court. The time allowed to get to and from
the employee’s parked vehicle and the court shall be the same as in

1984. This Order provides that each instance of City-paid parking
shall be limited to the duration of the employees’ court overtime
appearance and include actual time up to 30 minutes prior to the

procedures established for that purpose by the Police Department
Administration.

(d) The City shall be held harmless against any and all claims, actions
and lawsuits relating to theft or personal property damage brought
against the City by employees using parking facilities pursuant to
the parking allowance benefits provided herein. The City shall be
held harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, actions,
damages and judgments due to the employee’s operation of his or
her private vehicle at parking facilities which are subject to the
parking allowance benefits provided herein. Nothing herein would
operate to relieve the City of any liability it may have arising from
its actions or omissions or preclude the employee from pursuing
any rights or claims he/she may have under Wisconsin State

Statute 895.46.

c. Overtime earned as a result of an authorized eight-hour shift assignment which
falls outside the regularly scheduled eight-hour shift in whole or in part and which
because of the nature of the work performed does not fall within 2.a. or 2.b.,
above, shall be compensated at one and one-half (1%X) the base salary rate,
except that if an employee’s regularly scheduled eight-hour shift, as established
by the HOURS OF WORK provision of this Agreement, is changed, then all time
worked on the new regularly scheduled eight-hour shift shall be compensated at
(1X) the base salary rate.

(2)

Compensatory Time Off Balance (CTB)

The term “compensatory time off balance (CTB)”, as used in subsection 3
of this Article, shall mean the unused amount of overtime the employee has
earned that was compensated in time off instead of cash.

Overtime Earned

The term “overtime earned,” as used in subsection 3 of this Article, shall
mean the amount of overtime worked times the rate at which it is
compensated; for example, one hour of overtime worked that is
compensated at straight time rates (1X)*! under this Article shall equal one
hour of overtime earned and one hour of overtime worked that is
compensated at a rate of time and one-half (112X) under this Article shall

equal 1% hours of overtime earned.

b. Payment

All overtime earned for work performed during the term of this Agreement, shall

be paid for in cash except that:

qd)

If an employee’s compensatory time off balance (CTB) recorded on the
most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is less than 225
hours, the employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of
cash for each instance of overtime work performed after issuance of the
most current Status Report until issuance of the next Status Report which

indicates the employee’s CTB is equal to or greater than 225 hours.

' Less than two and one half hours of Court Overtime worked shall equal two and one half

hours of overtime earned at 1.5X Base Salary.

An employee may use compensatory time off on dates he/she has requested
provided the employee gives his/her commanding officer reasonable
advance notice of the dates requested and the dates are determined
available by the commanding officer in accordance with the needs of the
Police Service. The processing of requests for use of compensatory time
off shall be on a first-come, first-served basis. Decisions made by the
employee’s commanding officer with respect to the availability of the
dates the employee has requested shall be subject to all of the provisions
of subsections 3.b. (3) and (4).

The parties recognize and shall implement the U.S. Department of Labor’s
position that prior to denying a request to use accrued compensatory time,
and even when granting the request would bring operations below
prescribed staffing levels, an employer must first attempt operational
alternatives to fill its prescribed staffing levels by using replacement
officers at premium overtime rates when required by the FLSA.
Accordingly, the City, working with and through the Milwaukee Police
Association, has established a system which guarantees that no one is
denied compensatory time off when prescribed staffing levels can be met
through a replacement (paid at FLSA premium rates where they apply). If
a police officer is denied a request to use compensatory time on the
regularly scheduled shift that the officer has requested, whether on the
basis of prescribed staffing levels or for any other reason(s), the provisions
enumerated as subsections (a) through (k) at the end of this paragraph will
be utilized in order to obtain, when at all possible, a suitable replacement
for the officer, excepting under the following circumstances in which the
below-described duties fall within the officer’s regularly scheduled shift:

(aa) _ where that police officer is required to testify at a hearing, trial, or

35

(cc)

other proceeding on behalf of the City (including, inter alia, Fire
and Police Commission meetings or hearings, grievance arbitrations,
or lawsuits) to the exclusion of any other police officer, and where
he or she has not been subpoenaed to testify;

where a police officer is mandated to appear at a charging
conference in the office of the District Attorney, or before any other
public prosecutor, and where his or her involvement in the arrest or
other pertinent events mandates that the police officer appear to the
exclusion of any other police officer; and

in those circumstances where the police officer (excluding those
assigned to the Patrol Bureau and excepting those police officers

assigned to the Patrol Support Division), poss

 

sses unique technical
skills which are required to be made available to the Police
Department during a particular period of time. In the event that an
officer is denied compensatory time off (or is initially granted
compensatory time off and is subsequently denied) under this
subsection (cc), s/he shall be compensated at the rate of 1-1/2x (or
2x if cancelled within 24 hours of the start of the compensatory time
previously granted) for all hours of that shift for which
compensatory time off had been requested if the following
conditions are satisfied prior to notification by the Department that
s/he would be required to work during that time:
1. the officer made arrangements for a replacement; and
2. both the officer requesting compensatory time off and the
replacement executed and filed with the Department the forms
specified in Article 15 Section 3.b.(3)(1), of this paragraph,

below.

The Chief of Police shall develop a form, which will be posted at each work
location throughout the Police Department, upon which employees seeking
replacements may identify themselves and the pertinent date(s). The
availability of this form shall not preclude the use of replacements obtained
by police officers through other means. The following conditions will apply
to replacements obtained under this subsection. If these conditions are
fulfilled, the replacement will work in place of the employee who has
requested the use of compensatory time off and that request shall be

granted.
(a) Arrangements for a replacement must be made and confirmed at

least 48 hours in advance of the start of the compensatory time
which is to be taken off.

(b) The replacement worker is within the same “box” as shown on the
“Milwaukee Police Department Organizational Chart” attached
hereto as page 1 of Appendix G (as may be in effect, modified or
changed from time to time by the Department or the Fire and
Police Commission) as the employee exercising his/her right to use
compensatory time off, except as specifically provided on page 2
of Appendix G or unless the employee’s commanding officer in his
or her discretion approves a replacement obtained by the employee
from a different “box.” In the event that the Department or the
Fire and Police Commission modifies the organizational chart, the
parties will immediately engage in collective bargaining to provide

for reasonably comparable access to replacement workers.

(h)

The replacement must have more than one (1) year of service from
date of hire and must have completed field training.

The replacement must be of the same rank as the employee
requesting use of compensatory time off.

The replacement will be permitted to work as a replacement only
on a day when he/she would otherwise be on a regular day off.

An employee is ineligible to work as a replacement for more than
two (2) regular off days in a pay period.

An employee is ineligible to work as a replacement for more than
four (4) hours during a shift that immediately precedes or follows
that employee’s regular work shift, not to exceed two (2) occasions
per pay period. However, if, because of staggered shifts, the shift
of the officer who is being replaced ends or begins one hour before
or after the shift of the replacement officer, such shift shall be
deemed to “immediately” precede or follow the replacement’s
regular work shift. When this occurs, the replacement shall work
the one-hour of gap (for a maximum of five (5) hours work), which
gap time shall be compensated as if it was regular replacement
time, as specified in subsection (h), immediately below.

The regular shift replacement hours will be compensated in cash at
straight-time (1X) rates (except for the four (4) contractual
holidays specified at Article 32 paragraph | of this Agreement
which will be paid at 142X Base Salary). Time worked as a

replacement under this subsection shall be counted as “hours
worked” for FLSA purposes, so long as the requirements of the
FLSA apply to the City.

The replacement will not receive out-of-shift premium.

The replacement shall be subject to all of the obligations applicable
to any employee who is regularly scheduled for duty.

If the replacement reports sick on a day when he/she is scheduled
to work as a replacement, he/she will be ineligible thereafter to
work as a replacement for a period of 90 days. If the replacement
reports injured off-duty on a day when he/she is scheduled to work
as a replacement, the replacement will be ineligible thereafter to
work as a replacement for a period of 90 days unless: (1) the off-
duty injury occurred subsequent to the time at which the
replacement agreed to serve in that capacity; and (2) the
replacement provides medical substantiation of the off-duty injury.
A replacement will, at the time of his/her selection, execute on a
form prescribed by the Chief of Police his/her agreement to serve
as a replacement in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The officer taking compensatory time off who

arranged for the replacement will also execute this form.

An officer, at his/her option and under preexisting practices, may also seek a
“body-for-body” trade as allowable under 29 C.F.R. § 553.31 (“Substitution”) in

order to use compensatory time off when desired. This shall not be a prerequisite

39
 

20

to the procedure set forth in subsection 3.b.(2) and (3) for obtaining a

replacement.

Compensatory Time Off Segments

qd)

(2)

Subject to the terms and conditions provided for in subsection 3.b.(2) of
this Article, above, and except as provided in 3.c.(2), below, an employee
authorized to use earned compensatory time off must use it in units of
either eight-hour days or four-hour segments.

Subject to the terms and conditions provided for in subsection 3.b.(2) of
this Article, above, an employee may request to use earned compensatory
time off in units of one (1) hour for purposes of significant personal
importance. Such requests will be granted at the discretion of the
supervisor consistent with the needs of the service and shall not be denied
arbitrarily or capriciously. It is understood that the needs of the service

are of preeminent importance in weighing such requests.

All overtime shall be at the option of the Chief of Police.

Application of the provisions contained in this Article shall not involve pyramiding of

overtime.

During a period of time there are two (2) concurrent overtime rates, the

following procedure shall be used to determine the rate for that period:

a.

If both rates are at time and one-half (1X), the employee is paid at a rate of time

and one-half (142X).

If one of the rates is time and one-half (112X) and the other straight-time (1X), the

employee is paid at a rate of time and one-half (112X).

If both rates are straight-time (1X), the employee is paid at a straight-time (1X)

40
 

20

rate.

d. For purposes of construction and interpretation of this provision, a court
appearance involving the three and three quarter hour court overtime minimum
payment shall be deemed a two and one-half-hour period of time and one-half
(1.5X) overtime beginning with the start of such court appearance.

The hourly pay used in the computation of overtime shall be equal to one-eightieth (1/80)

of the employee’s current biweekly base salary as provided for in the BASE SALARY

provision of this Agreement.

Overtime shall be compensated for each actual hour or nearest 0.1 of an hour of

authorized overtime worked.

Any payment made under the provisions of this Article shall not have any sum deducted

for pension benefits nor shall such payments be included in the determination of pension

benefits or other fringe benefits.

The terms and conditions agreed to between the parties in respect to Police Band

overtime (except as stated below), court overtime parking and negative comp time

balances, which are set forth respectively in City/MPA Memoranda of Understanding
dated: September 14, 1983 (Police Band Overtime), October 12, 1983, and November

16, 1983 (Court Overtime Parking) and December 15, 1983 (Negative Comp Time

Balances) shall be incorporated into the provisions of this Article and be made a part of

this Agreement as Appendix B. The terms and conditions of the Memorandum of

September 14, 1983 (Police Band Overtime) shall be amended to provide that the

Compensatory Time Off Bank (CTB) time is the same as provided in subsection 3.b.(1)

of this Article.

Miscellaneous Overtime Provisions

Roll Call

Existing roll-call time practices will be maintained for the term of this Agreement
or any agreed-upon extension thereof. Effective August 11, 1985, and for so long
as employees are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) during the
term of this Agreement, or any agreed upon extension thereof, the 18-minute roll-
call period shall be reduced to a 12-minute period with all overtime earned during
such 12-minute period compensated at time and one-half (12X) the base salary
rate. If and when employees are no longer covered by the FLSA, the roll-call
period shall be increased to an 18-minute period and overtime earned as a result
of roll-call shall be compensated at base salary rates (1X). Identification
Technicians who are assigned to perform street duties shall attend roll call and
receive roll call pay.

Compensatory Time Off

If and when the City is required by law to pay cash for overtime work performed
that could otherwise have been paid for in compensatory time off under the
provisions of this Agreement, the City may modify overtime provisions to assure
that overtime compensation (whether in cash, compensatory time, or both) for all

overtime work performed shall not exceed 142X the employee’s base rate of pay.

Fire and Police Commission Overtime shall be defined as time spent by an employee
outside of his/her regularly scheduled eight-hour work shift, (as such eight-hour work shift
is defined under the HOURS OF WORK Article of this Agreement) under subpoena at a
trial proceeding conducted by the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners (FPC);
provided such FPC trial proceeding resulted from either a citizen complaint filed with the
FPC, or an appeal from discipline administered by the Chief of Police, and provided
further that the employee so subpoenaed was involved in the incident which gave rise to
the complaint or the discipline. The extent of involvement occasioning an employee's
appearance at a FPC trial proceeding, where such appearance was solely for the
dispositional phase of that proceeding, shall, in addition to covering involvement in the
incident which gave rise to the complaint or the discipline, cover any other involvement
such employee had in the course of his/her employment in the Police Department with the
defendant(s) in such complaint or discipline. The term, "FPC trial proceeding," as used
herein, shall also include FPC conciliation proceedings.

Limitations

made by the Chief of Police. Overtime assignments made by the Chief of Police
shall be covered by Article 15 of this Agreement entitled OVERTIME.

proceeding for which the employee received Fire and Police Commission
Overtime pay, and make no subsequent claim for this money whatsoever.

proceeding, shall be compensated at:

(1) Base salary rates (1X) for all time spent at such appearance when the
appearance is less than or equal to two hours in duration; however, a
minimum of two hours' pay at base salary rates (1X) shall be granted
an employee when he/she is subpoenaed to appear at such FPC trial
proceeding on his/her own time, reports thereto, and is excused
before completing the two-hour minimum.

(2) Base salary rates (1X) for the first two hours of such appearance and
at time and one-half (1 1/2X) the base salary rate for all time in
excess of the first two hours of such appearance, when such
appearance is greater than two hours in duration.

b. Fire and Police Commission Overtime earned as a result of an appearance at a FPC
trial proceeding that was solely for the dispositional phase of the trial proceeding,
shall be compensated at a flat rate equal to two (2) hours of pay computed at the

amount provided hereunder shall not be construed as a limitation on the length of
an employee's appearance at such dispositional phase.

Fire and Police Commission Overtime Payments

Fire and Police Commission Overtime earned under the provisions of this Article shall be

compensated for in cash or compensatory time off in accordance with, and subject to, the

provisions of subsection 3 set forth in Article 15 of this Agreement. Fire and Police

Commission Overtime earned, that is compensated for in compensatory time off shall

count towards the employee's CTB and be recorded on the Police Department Personnel

Status Reports. For purposes of interpretation and construction of the provisions of this

subsection, each instance of Fire and Police Commission Overtime worked of less than

and Police Commission Overtime earned.

Employees receiving compensation under the provisions of this Article for an appearance
at a FPC trial proceeding shall be covered by the provisions of subsection 2.b.(4) set forth

1.

Benefits

a.

Basic Plan

During the term of this Agreement, Basic Plan health insurance benefits shall be

the same as the Basic Plan benefits that were provided in the 2007-2009

City/Association Agreement, including the following provisions:

qd)

(2)

Every medical procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis shall
not be covered by these benefits when the procedure is performed on a
hospital inpatient basis. Procedures that can be performed on an outpatient
basis that are done on an inpatient basis in conjunction with other
procedures requiring inpatient status, or any procedures performed on an
inpatient basis that constitute a medically verifiable exception (as
determined by the Utilization Review Contractor) to the requirement that it
be performed on an outpatient basis, shall be covered.

A Utilization Review Case Management Program (UR/CM) program shall
be established by the City for all elective procedures. Elective procedures
subject to the UR/CM program shall include all treatments for mental
health disorders and substance abuse and home health care services. The
program would be an independent review that assures each patient that the
proposed hospitalization is necessary, based upon the medical condition of
the patient, delivered in the most appropriate medical setting (inpatient or
outpatient) and fair and equitably priced. Whenever an elective procedure
is recommended for an employee, or his/her dependents, by a physician, the
employee shall be required to notify the designated UR/CM program
representative of this fact by telephone at the time such procedure is
recommended, in accordance with procedures established by the Employee
Benefits Manager for that purpose. Any elective procedure not submitted

to the designated UR/CM program representative shall not be covered by

54
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

these benefits. UR/CM shall determine whether or not a procedure is
elective. Within 48 hours of the hospital admission time for any urgent or
emergency procedure performed on an employee, or his/her dependents, the
employee or adult responsible for him/her, shall be required to notify the
designated UR/CM program representative of this fact by telephone in
accordance with procedures established by the Employee Benefits Manager
for that purpose; provided however, that if bona fide medical circumstances
applicable to the employee preclude compliance with the 48-hour
notification requirement, UR/CM shall authorize reasonable extension of
this time limit consistent with such medical circumstances or the
availability of an adult responsible for the employee. Following its review
of an elective procedure contemplated for an employee, or his/her
dependents, UR/CM will inform the employee of its determination in
respect to approval or denial of the procedure. After the patient informs
his/her physician that the proposed elective procedure must be approved by
the UR/CM program representative and the physician has contacted such
representative, the UR/CM program will determine if the procedure will be
approved or denied. If the physician and the UR/CM program
representative disagree, discussions between them will continue in an
attempt to resolve the disagreement. If discussions over five working days
do not resolve the issue, the Employe Benefits Manager shall appoint a
local physician who practices in a medical field relevant to the
contemplated elective procedure and who is not affiliated with the
employee's physician. The second physician's findings shall be submitted
to the UR/CM program representative for review. If the second physician's
prescribed treatment is approved by the UR/CM program representative, it

shall be the treatment which is covered. In the event that both physicians

either prescribe the same course of treatment, or each prescribes a different
one, and the procedure(s) does(do) not meet the standards of the UR/CM
program representative, and no compromise can be effected, the UR/CM
program representative will approve the course of treatment prescribed by
the employee's physician. Once established, the foregoing appeal
procedure shall remain in effect until the execution date of the successor
contract to this Agreement.
The major medical deductible shall be $100 per person, $300 per family
maximum on the Basic Plan.
Transplant Benefit
(a) Medically necessary human to human heart transplants shall be a
covered benefit under the Basic Plan. The participant must obtain
prior authorization from the Utilization Review Contractor. The
Utilization Review Contractor shall determine the medical necessity.
(b) The aggregate lifetime maximum benefit limit per participant for all
organ or tissue transplant services for all covered transplant
procedures is $250,000. This aggregate lifetime maximum benefit
limit applies to all benefits arising out of an organ or tissue
transplant.
The maximum annual benefit per participant for outpatient services for
alcoholism, drug abuse and nervous and mental disorders provided in the
outpatient department of a hospital, an Outpatient Treatment Facility or a
physician's office, that is provided under the "Hospital Surgical-Medical
Group Master Plan Document for City of Milwaukee" shall be two
thousand dollars ($2,000). The maximum benefits provided under the
"Major Medical Coverage" section of the Basic Plan for benefits for

professional services for psychiatric care, including any type of nervous or

56
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

two thousand ($2,000) of charges.
The Major Medical lifetime maximum benefit shall be

$500,000.

b. Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans

qd)

2)

GB)

Except as provided in subsection 1.b.(2), hereunder, employees shall have
the right to select coverage under an HMO Plan approved by the City in
lieu of coverage provided by the Basic Plan. The benefits of the HMO
plans will be substantially the same as the Basic Plan benefits. The
benefits for employees enrolled in an HMO plan offered by the City shall
be the uniform benefits specified in the 1999-2000 City of Milwaukee's
Request for Proposals from Health Maintenance Organizations.

The City may offer to employees an Exclusive Provider Organization
(EPO) Plan instead of or in addition to a Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO) Plan. An EPO Plan offered by the City shall use a Southeastern
Wisconsin network and shall only include in-network benefits. There shall
be no coverage for services obtained outside of the EPO Plan network. The
benefits for employees enrolled in an EPO Plan offered by the City shall be
the uniform benefits specified in the 1999-2000 City of Milwaukee’s
Request for Proposals from Health Maintenance Organizations. In the
event that the City offers an EPO Plan instead of or in addition to an HMO
Plan, any references to “Health Maintenance Organization” or “HMO” in
this Agreement shall be understood to also refer to an “Exclusive Provider
Organization”, “EPO”, or to a combination of Health Maintenance
Organizations and Exclusive Provider Organizations.

Effective January 1, 2008, the following co-payments shall be

determined by the plan:

amount of earned and unused sick leave credited to an employee's sick leave
account on the effective date of his/her retirement.

subscriber cost for the enrollment status applicable to the retiree and represents
the maximum contribution made by the City on behalf of such retiree.

If the per capita subscriber cost for enrollment in the plan selected by the
retiree exceeds the maximum City contribution for retirees provided, the retiree
shall have the amount of such excess cost deducted from his/her pension
check.

Surviving Spouse

The provisions of subsection 3.c.(1) shall be applicable to a surviving spouse
eligible for retiree health insurance benefits under subsections 2.b or 2.c. of

this Article. An eligible surviving spouse without eligible dependents shall be

70
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

covered by subsection 3.c.(1)(a); in all other circumstances he/she shall be
covered by subsection 3.c.(1)(b). For purposes of interpretation and
administration, the age the deceased retiree would have been shall determine
the City contribution.
Duty Death
Depending on single/family enrollment status, the cost of coverage for the surviving
spouse of an employee receiving a duty death pension, under either Section 36.05(5)
of the ERS Act or Chapter 35.01(34) of the Milwaukee City Charter, shall be as

toward meeting the subscriber cost for enrollment in the plan elected of up to
100% of the monthly subscriber cost of either single or family enrollment in
the Basic Plan. If the subscriber cost for enrollment in the plan elected exceeds
the maximum City contribution provided, the employee shall have the amount
of excess cost deducted from his/her paycheck on a monthly basis.

shall be in lieu of the benefits provided under subsection 3. c.
Thereafter, until attainment of age 65, the cost of such coverage shall be
as provided under subsection 3.c. of this Article, except that the

Cost of Coverage -- Dental Plan Only

For calendar years 2010, 2011 and 2012, the City will contribute an amount up to $13.00 per
month for single enrollment and an amount up to $37.50 per month for family enrollment
towards meeting the subscriber cost of the dental plan. If the subscriber cost for single or
family enrollment in the Dental Plan exceeds the maximum City contribution provided, the
employee shall have the amount of such excess cost deducted from his/her paycheck on a
monthly basis.

Self-Administration Offset

The per capita subscriber costs associated with the health or dental insurance coverage
provided by each of the plans listed in subsection 1., above, includes amounts allocable to
the administrative costs of the carriers providing such coverage. If the City elects to self-
administer the Basic Plan and/or the Basic Dental Plan, then effective with the calendar
month during which this election becomes effective, and so long as it continues in effect, the
maximum City contributions provided in subsections 3 and 4, above, for employees covered
by such a self-administered plan shall be reduced by an amount equal to 100% of the
difference between the monthly administrative costs associated with such plan prior to the
effective date it became self-administered and the monthly administrative costs associated
with the plan when it is self-administered, capitated for each subscriber in the plans on the
basis of single or family enrollment status. While in effect, this provision shall not increase
an employee's payroll deductions required to meet the costs of his/her health/dental
insurance benefits beyond the deductions that would be required under subsections 3, 4 and
8 of this Article, if the provision was not in effect.

Right of City to Select Carrier

It shall be the right of the City to select and, from time to time, to change any of its carriers
that provide the benefits set forth in subsection 1. of this Article; at its sole option, the City
shall have the right to provide any or all of these benefits on a self-insured basis and/or to

self-administer them (in this circumstance, the term "carrier" as used in this Article shall

also mean self-insurer and/or self-administrator).

Non-duplication

a.

If more than one City employee is a member of the same family, as that term is
defined in provisions of the Plans defined in subsection 1. of this Article, the
coverage shall be limited to one family plan.

In the event a program of health insurance is adopted by the Federal or State
government and the City is required or elects to participate, benefits under the City
plan shall be coordinated with such systems but shall not operate to increase or
diminish the extent of the coverage.

A retiree shall be ineligible to receive the retiree health insurance benefits provided
hereunder when receiving health insurance benefits from other employment or from
the employment of the retiree's spouse if the benefits received by the spouse cover
the retiree.

City health insurance cost contributions provided hereunder to retirees shall be in
lieu of any other City retiree health insurance contributions provided by ordinance,
resolution or by other means, while retirees are receiving the benefits hereunder.
After the deductible is paid, the employee's share of the cost for claims made under
the Major Medical co-insurance provisions shall not be less than 20%.

In the event an employee becomes eligible for Medicare benefits prior to attaining
age 65, the City will contribute an amount up to the City's maximum contribution
provided in subsection 3.c.(1), of this Article towards the cost of coverage for the

City's Medicare Supplemental Plan.

Employees on Leave of Absence

Employees in active service may elect to be covered by the benefits in subsections 1.a. or

1.b. of this Article, above, while on an authorized leave of absence. Individuals on an

authorized leave of absence shall pay 100% of the cost associated with their coverage. The

rates for such coverage shall be determined by the City and may be adjusted from time to

time. This provision shall be applicable only during the first 12 months of an employee's
authorized leave of absence.
There shall be a 270-day waiting period for pre-existing conditions for the benefits provided
by the Basic Plan.
An employee who retires on pension during the term of this Agreement shall be entitled to
the benefits provided during the term of this Agreement so long as he or she is less than age
65. After this Agreement expires, such an individual, so long as he or she is less than age
65, shall be entitled to:
(1) The same health insurance benefits concurrently provided employees in active
service covered by the effective Agreement between the City and the
Association as is in effect from time to time (it is understood that the exclusion
of retirees from coverage under dental insurance benefits, as set forth above,
shall continue unchanged). If a retiree eligible for these benefits dies prior to
age 65, the retiree's surviving spouse shall be eligible for these benefits until
the last day of the month in which the deceased retiree would have attained age
65; and
(2) The same City/retiree health insurance cost sharing formula that was provided
for such retiree by this Agreement.
This paragraph shall only cover the kinds of retirements for which health
insurance coverage is provided by this Agreement.
Effective Date
Except where specifically provided otherwise herein, the provisions of this Article shall be
deemed to be in force and effect beginning January 1, 2010, and ending December 31, 2012.
Subject to the conditions contained therein, the parties agree to abide by the retiree health
insurance provisions of the October 29, 1999 Final Global Settlement Agreement for Active
Police Officers.

ARTICLE 22

SICK LEAVE

1.

Definition: "Sick Leave" shall mean all necessary absence from duty because of illness,
bodily injury, or exclusion from employment because of exposure to contagious disease.
Eligibility for sick leave with pay for employees newly appointed to City employment shall
begin after completion of six months active service in the Police Department, but sick leave
credit shall be earned from date of appointment.

Employees shall earn sick leave with pay at the rate of one and one-quarter (1%) working
days for each month of active service or 4.6 working hours for each two weeks of active
service. Sick leave with pay earned by employees shall be credited to their sick leave
account. Employees may utilize sick leave with pay credited to their accounts during
periods of sick leave for the period of time they would have worked in accordance with the
regularly scheduled hours of work as established under the HOURS OF WORK provision of
this Agreement.

Regardless of the sick leave credit earned the maximum amount of sick leave with pay
which employees may utilize from their accounts for any one period of continuous sick
leave shall not exceed 365 calendar days. Interruption of such period of sick leave shall
only be considered if the employee resumes his/her regular duty.

Whenever an employee requests sick leave with pay he or she shall immediately notify his
or her commanding officer of this fact. Such notification may be by telephone. Each

instance of sick leave that the employee fails to comply with the requirements of this
subsection shall result in the employee losing his/her entitlement to any sick leave with pay
for that instance.

Except as otherwise provided herein, sick leave may be permitted without requiring the
employee to submit medical substantiation from a private physician, provided that the
employee completes Form PS-16 (Application for Sick Leave), and submits same to his or
her commanding officer. An employee may be required by his or her commanding officer
to provide acceptable medical substantiation from a private physician or dentist for each
absence, regardless of duration, if the commanding officer is informed or believes that the
employee is misusing sick leave. The City shall not be responsible for the payment of any
fee charged by the physician or dentist to provide the acceptable medical substantiation.
When medical substantiation from an employee's private physician is required, the failure of
the employee to comply with this requirement shall permit the City to deny that employee
the sick leave benefits provided hereunder until he/she is in compliance with such
requirement.

The sick leave account for an employee returning to active service from duty disability
retirement shall be the employee's unused sick leave credit or 30 working days of sick leave,
whichever is greater.

Employees reporting absent on sick leave shall be governed by the rules and regulations and
standard operating procedures of the Police Department pertaining thereto in effect on the

execution date of this Agreement.

10. Attendance Incentive Program

2012.

ARTICLE 25

INJURY PAY

1.

When employees, covered by this Agreement, sustain injuries within the scope of their
employment for which they are entitled to receive worker's compensation temporary
disability benefits, as provided by Chapter 102 of the Wisconsin Statutes (Worker's
Compensation Act), they may receive 80% of their base salary as "injury pay" instead of
such worker's compensation benefits for the period of time they may be temporarily totally
or temporarily partially disabled because of such injuries. Such injury pay shall not be
granted for more than 365 calendar days for any one compensable injury or recurrence
thereof. A compensable injury associated with or arising from one or more separate
incidents occurring prior to the incident constituting its immediate cause shall be deemed a
recurrence and shall not give rise to additional injury pay entitlement. The 80% provision
shall become effective January 1, 1985, and shall cover employees receiving injury pay
benefits on or after that date regardless of the date on which the compensable injury, or
recurrence thereof, occurred.

In providing injury pay in an amount equal to 80% of the employee's base salary, the
employee agrees to allow the City to make a payroll adjustment to his/her biweekly
paycheck deducting an amount equal to 20% of his/her base salary for that portion of the
pay period he/she received injury pay and make no subsequent claim for said amount
whatsoever. Such deduction shall be administered so as not to reduce employee pension
benefits. For purposes of interpretation of the provisions of this Article, the term base salary
as used herein shall mean the employee's base salary pay rate in effect during the pay period
he/she is claiming injury pay as that base salary rate is established in the BASE SALARY
Article of this Agreement.

After "injury pay" benefits have been exhausted, employees shall have the option of
accepting sick leave benefits or accepting worker's compensation temporary disability
benefits. This option, which shall be in writing, may be terminated without prejudice to

80
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits under the Worker's Compensation
Act thereafter, but such termination shall not be retroactive and any sick leave already used
at the time of such termination of option shall not be restored to the employee.

Questions involving eligibility for injury pay shall be determined under the applicable law
and the substantive and procedural rules of the Department of Workforce Development
relative to Worker's Compensation and in the event of a dispute between the City and the
employee relative to such eligibility, the Department of Workforce Development and the
courts upon the statutorily prescribed review thereof shall be the sole and final arbiters of
such dispute.

In all third-party claims or actions, the City shall not be limited in its recovery to the amount
of temporary disability benefits which would otherwise have been payable under the
Worker's Compensation Act, but shall instead be entitled to recover the amount of injury pay
received by the employee. In the event the City recovers an amount of injury pay received
by the employee, the City shall restore the employee's number of calendar days (equivalent
amount of recovery) for said injury.

Whenever an employee sustains a compensable injury, he or she shall immediately notify
his or her commanding officer of this fact. Each instance of injury pay that the employee
fails to comply with the requirement of this subsection shall result in the employee losing
his/her entitlement to any injury pay for that instance.

Employees reporting absent due to a compensable injury shall be governed by the Rules and
Regulations and Standard Operating Procedure of the Police Department pertaining thereto.
If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines that the injury pay benefits provided
hereunder are taxable as wages, then beginning with the effective date of such
determination, the City will no longer require the 20% employee deduction from injury pay
benefits provided for in subsections |. and 2. of this Article, above.

In no case shall temporary disability benefits and injury pay be allowed for the same period

of time.

11.

Employees appointed to the Police Officer position classification shall not be entitled to the
injury pay benefits provided hereunder for any injury they may sustain while on duty prior
to the start of field training during the period of time they are assigned to the Police Training
Academy for recruit training. Such employees shall instead be covered by State of
Wisconsin Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) temporary disability benefits during such
period, including all applicable terms and conditions provided for in the WCA. The
provisions of subsections 6, 7 and 9, above, shall be applicable to employees governed by
this subsection.

During the period of an employee's absence from duty due to a duty-incurred injury, the
employee shall be permitted to leave his/her residence or place of confinement so long as
he/she has first obtained a written statement from his/her personal physician stating that such
travel will further his/her recuperation and the employee has first presented his/her personal
physician's statement to his/her commanding officer or shift commander. Whenever an
employee authorized to leave his/her residence or place of confinement, leaves the confines
of Milwaukee County, he/she shall provide his/her commanding officer written advance
notice of this departure indicating on the notice the time period he/she will be out of
Milwaukee County, location(s) where he/she can be reached and, if a location has an address
and/or telephone number, the address and/or telephone number of the location(s). While
outside the confines of Milwaukee County, the employee shall be required to notify his/her
commanding officer of his/her whereabouts by telephone of any changes in the locations
indicated on the advance notice. During any fifteen (15) day period, an employee shall not
be permitted to remain outside the confines of Milwaukee County for more than 14
consecutive calendar days. Except as provided herein and in subsection 6 of the
VACATION Article of this Agreement, Rule 5, Section 7 of the Milwaukee Police
Department Rules and Regulations shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

ARTICLE 26

TERMINAL LEAVE

1.

An employee retiring on City pension under either the Employees’ Retirement System of
Milwaukee plan or the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund plan (but excluding retirement
on deferred pension when employee has less than 25 years' service or actuarially reduced
pension, as they are defined in both plans) shall, upon retirement, be entitled to receive a
lump sum payment equivalent to one eight-hour workday's base salary for each one eight-
hour day of the employee's earned and unused sick leave up to a maximum of fifty-five (55)
such equivalent eight-hour workdays of base salary. The term "eight-hour workday's base
salary," as used herein, is defined as an amount equivalent to the employee's biweekly base
salary, as defined and determined by the BASE SALARY Article of this Agreement, divided
by 10.

When a terminal leave payment is paid to a deferred retiree with 25 or more years' service,
the payment will be made on the deferred retiree's effective date of separation based on
his/her pay rate and sick leave accumulation in effect at that time.

An employee shall be eligible to receive the terminal leave pay benefit only once during
his/her lifetime.

Terminal leave payments shall not be construed as being part of employee's base salary and
shall not be included in the computation of any fringe benefits enumerated in this
Agreement.

Terminal leave payments shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall
such payments be included in any computation establishing pension benefits or payments.

vacation anniversary date shall not change.

Active Service: The time spent as a regular employee on the City of Milwaukee
payroll including the performance of assigned duties for the City and paid time not
worked. In order for paid time to count as active service for vacation purposes, such
time, together with any authorized unpaid leaves of absence must be continuous from
the date of appointment. Active service shall also include the time spent by an
employee who takes a military leave. In the event of an employee's resignation,
discharge or retirement from City employment, active service shall cease as of the
employee's last day at work.

Year of Service: The duration of time in active service.

2. Eligibility for vacation shall begin after the completion of twelve (12) months of active

However, if the employee leaves the service of the City before the completion of the initial

An employee shall earn vacation time at the following rates:

a.

qd)

(4)

Rates For Calendar Years 2010, 2011 and 2012

Eight (8) hours for each calendar month of active service since an employee's
last anniversary date up to a maximum of eighty (80) hours per calendar year
for an employee with less than seven (7) years of active service.

Twelve (12) hours for each calendar month of active service since an
employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of one hundred twenty
(120) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least seven (7) years but
less than twelve (12) years of active service.

Sixteen (16) hours for each calendar month of active service since the
employee's last anniversary date, up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160)
hours per calendar year for an employee with at least twelve (12) years but less
than twenty (20) years of active service .

Twenty (20) hours for each calendar month of active service since an
employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of two hundred (200) hours
per calendar year for an employee with at least twenty (20) years of active

service.

b. For purposes of pro-rating, an employee in active service for at least fourteen (14)

days in a calendar month shall be deemed as having been in active service for the full

calendar month; in the event the employee is in active service for less than 14 days in

a calendar month, then the employee shall be deemed as not being in active service

at all during the calendar month.

c. The time period during which an employee earns vacation with pay for a calendar

year shall be limited to the employee's period of active service between his/her

anniversary date for that calendar year and his/her immediate preceding anniversary
date. The amount of vacation time taken during a calendar year, except for
separation from service as provided in subsection 5 below, shall be limited to the
maximums noted in this subsection, above. These maximums are not guarantees; an
employee is not entitled to any greater vacation with pay in a calendar year than that
which he/she has earned for that calendar year.
Employees must use vacation time during the calendar year for which such vacation time is
earned; employees who do not use all of their entitled vacation time within the calendar year
for which it was earned shall lose all rights to the unused time off.
Vacation time taken before the full amount has been earned shall be considered time owed
the City until it is earned. Any employee who leaves the service of the City due to
resignation, retirement, termination, discharge, layoff or death will have the compensation
for vacation time owed the City deducted from the final paycheck. In the event the
employee's last pay check is for an amount less than the amount of compensation owed the
City, a deduction shall also be made from the employee's next preceding pay check that
covers the balance of compensation owed the City. Any employee who leaves the service of
the City due to resignation, retirement, layoff or death or who takes military leave will be
paid for earned vacation time that has accumulated. If an employee returns to duty prior to
his/her next following anniversary date, any vacation time earned and taken hereunder shall
be offset against the employee's earned vacation time for the calendar year in which that
anniversary date falls. Discharge employees are not entitled to pay for accumulated
vacation time.
An employee on authorized injury leave as a result of a duty-incurred injury may use
vacation scheduled during the period of such leave provided the Police Department
Administration receives a written advance request to use the vacation, which indicates the
time and place of the vacation, and provided further, the employee's private physician has

authorized use of this vacation. Injured employees not using vacation scheduled during the

period of their leave shall have their unused vacation rescheduled by the Police Department
Administration when they return to duty, if it is possible to do so, before the end of the
calendar year. In the event the Police Department Administration is unable to reschedule all
of the employee's remaining unused vacation before the end of the calendar year, the
employee shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equivalent to the dollar value of
the remaining unused vacation at the end of the calendar year, computed on the basis of the
employee's base salary rate in effect at the time for which the vacation was originally
scheduled. This lump sum payment shall be made as soon as is administratively practicable
following the end of the calendar year. The lump sum payment shall not be construed as
being part of the employee's base salary and shall not be included in the computation of any
fringe benefits enumerated in this Agreement. The lump sum payment shall not have any
sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall it be included in any computation establishing
pension benefits or payments. When authorized by the Police Department Administration,
an employee may elect to carry over into the next succeeding calendar year any remaining
unused vacation that the Police Department Administration was unable to reschedule by the
end of the calendar year, instead of the lump sum payment provided above. The vacation
carried over shall be used by March | of the following calendar year or the employee will
lose all rights to it, including all rights to the lump sum payment provided above. The
scheduling of carried-over vacation shall be subject to availability of the dates requested by
the employee, require prior approval by the employee's Commanding Officer and in no way
affect the scheduling of other employees’ vacations.

Employees on authorized sick leave shall have their vacation that was scheduled during such
leave rescheduled by the Police Department Administration when they return to duty if it is
possible to do so before the end of the calendar year. In the event the Police Department
Administration is unable to reschedule all of the employee's remaining unused vacation
before the end of the calendar year, the City, upon the employee's return to duty, will restore

to the employee's sick leave account an amount of time equal to the amount of unused

Employees in active service shall have time spent receiving a duty disability retirement

allowance included as years of service for purposes of computing current and prospective

vacation benefits.

Segmented Vacation Periods

a.

An employee may segment up to all of the portion of his/her maximum annual
vacation time entitlement earned under paragraph 3 that exceeds eighty (80) hours
into units of one (1), two (2), three (3) or four (4) consecutive eight-hour work days.
The aggregate amount of an employee's segmented vacation for a calendar year shall
be deemed a segmented vacation period. All other vacation benefits to which an
employee is entitled shall be taken in five (5) consecutive eight-hour workday units
in accordance with existing Departmental practices.

A segmented vacation period may be used during the time period from January 1
through and including December 31 of a calendar year.

An employee requesting a segmented vacation period in a calendar year shall, prior
to March 15 of such calendar year, notify his/her commanding officer in writing of
this fact on a form provided by the City, setting forth thereon the number of
segmented days requested. Notification requirements as to the specific dates
requested by the employee for his/her segmented vacation shall be as set forth in
subsection 9.d., below. An employee failing to comply with this requirement shall
not be permitted a segmented vacation period during such calendar year. The Police
Department Administration shall have the authority to limit the aggregate number of
segmented vacation days requested in the time period provided for in subsection b.,
above, if it determines that granting additional requests for segmented vacation
periods will result in insufficient manpower being available to meet the needs of the
Police Service.

For each unit of segmented vacation, the employee shall provide his/her

commanding officer with reasonable advance notice indicating the date(s) on which
the employee wants to use such unit of segmented vacation; such advance notice
shall be provided in writing no later than 72 hours prior to the first day of the
segmented unit of vacation. Except for requested segmented vacation dates
occurring on or before March 15 of the calendar year, no requested dates for
segmented vacation will be processed by the Department until all non-segmented
vacations for that calendar year have been selected by every employee in the
Association bargaining unit. All segmented days must be scheduled or requested on
or before October 15th of the calendar year; provided, however, that subject to the
approval of an employee's commanding officer, the October 15 deadline may be
waived because of emergency, or other extraordinary circumstance, affecting the
employee. An employee failing to comply with requirements of this subsection shall
have his/her unused segmented vacation time scheduled for him/her by his/her
commanding officer.

All requests made by employees for scheduling units of segmented vacation that are
submitted in accordance with the time limit and notice requirements provided above
shall be processed on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the availability of the
dates requested determined by the employee's commanding officer. No request will
be granted that results in another employee losing any non-segmented vacation dates
he/she had previously selected in accordance with Departmental practices established
for that purpose. In the event an employee's request for scheduling a unit of
segmented vacation is in compliance with all of the time limit and advance notice
requirements provided above, but the employee's commanding officer has
determined that some or all of the dates requested by the employee for that unit are
unavailable, it shall be the responsibility of the employee to schedule available

substitute dates with his/her commanding officer.

and only vacation benefits to which employees covered by this Agreement shall be entitled
during calendar years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

The assignment and scheduling of vacations with pay shall be controlled by the Chief of
Police. However, in exercising those controls, supervisors charged with the responsibility of
scheduling vacations shall not be prohibited from tentatively agreeing to allow members to
rearrange their scheduled off days in order to change the starting date of a non-segmented
vacation, if projected staffing needs would appear to permit such a rearrangement. If it is
necessary to revoke the tentative approval granted due to staffing needs, the member shall be
given notice no later than seven days prior to the first day the member is tentatively

scheduled to be absent.

ARTICLE 29

TIME OFF FOR JURY DUTY

1.

Employees covered by this Agreement shall be granted time off with pay for jury duty when
they are legally summoned for jury duty, subject to the terms and conditions provided for in
subsections 2 through 6, inclusive, of this Article, below.

When an employee is legally summoned to report for jury duty he/she shall:

a) Immediately notify his/her commanding officer and promptly submit to him/her a
written report, in "matter of" form, showing the date he/she is required to report for
such jury duty; and

b) Complete City of Milwaukee form C-139 (Application for Jury Duty Pay) and
County of Milwaukee form 2448R16 (Official Jury Notice), and forward both
documents to the Police Department Administration Bureau-Payroll Section; and

c) Submit a Certification of Jury Service form to the Police Department Administration
Bureau--Payroll Section at the end of his/her jury duty. Copies of this form may be

employee's off-duty days are changed, the employee shall be required to turn over all jury
duty payments he/she receives (excluding official travel pay) to the City; in the event the
employee's off-duty days are not changed he/she shall be entitled to retain the jury duty
payments he/she receives for jury duty performed on his/her off-duty days, but shall be
required to turn over to the City all other jury duty payments he/she receives (excluding
official travel pay).

Employees shall not be eligible for overtime while on jury duty, even if such duty extends
beyond eight hours in one day; nor shall they be eligible for overtime for work performed
outside their regularly scheduled work shift that is the result of changes made pursuant to
subsection 3. of this Article, above.

On days when the employee is normally scheduled to work, no greater amount of time off
for jury duty shall be granted than is necessary. If an employee is called for jury duty on
such day and reports thereto without receiving a jury assignment for that day, or if he/she is
engaged in jury duty for part of such day, he/she shall immediately notify his/her
commanding officer of this fact by telephone and report back to work for the remainder of
his/her work day. If the employee is engaged in jury duty for part of a day that falls on a
work day, then such requirement to report back to work shall not be applicable on days
where the amount of time remaining in the employee's regularly scheduled eight-hour shift
for that day, together with travel time from the jury duty site to the employee's duty
assignment location, does not allow for a work period of reasonable length; in this
circumstance, the employee shall still be required to notify his/her commanding officer in
accordance with the requirement set forth above. The criteria used in determining what
constitutes reasonable length shall be based on present Police Department practices covering
jury duty; notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee released from jury duty prior to 12:00

noon on a work day must report back to work for the remainder of his/her work day.

ARTICLE 31

TIME OFF IN LIEU OF HOLIDAYS

1.

Employees shall be entitled to receive up to ninety-six (96) hours off with pay in lieu of
holidays per fiscal year, one eight-hour period of which shall be designated by the Chief of
Police to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday.

Employees in active service less than a fiscal year shall be entitled to time off in lieu of
holidays with pay prorated on the basis of their length of service during the fiscal year.
Time off in lieu of holidays shall be earned at a rate of eight (8) hours per calendar month
for each calendar month in a calendar year that the employee was on the Police Department
payroll. For purposes of interpretation of this provision, an employee on the Police
Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as having been
on the Police Department payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is
on the Police Department payroll for less than 14 days in a calendar month, then the
employee shall be deemed as not having been on the payroll at all during such calendar
month.

Except as provided in subsection 4 of this Article, below, such time off with pay shall be
used by the employee in the fiscal year in which they are earned; employees who do not use
all of their entitled time off in lieu of holidays within the fiscal year in which it was earned
shall lose all right to the unused time off.

If an employee is unable to use all of the time off in lieu of holidays with pay to which the
employee is entitled during a fiscal year because of an extended period of authorized sick

leave that does not allow the Chief of Police to reschedule some or all of the employee's

96

unused time off in lieu of holidays in that fiscal year, then the City, upon the employee's
return to duty in the next fiscal year, will restore to the employee's sick leave account an
amount of time equal to the amount of such unused time off in lieu of holidays with pay that
the Chief of Police was unable to reschedule. This provision shall only cover time off in
lieu of holidays that is not integrated into the employee's regular work schedule. (In the case
of an employee assigned to a District Station on an eight-hour shift basis whose regular
work schedule is five days on-duty, two days off-duty, followed by four days on-duty, two
days off-duty, etc., this provision would cover the 32 hours off in lieu of holidays per fiscal
year that are not integrated into the employee's regular work schedule and would not cover
any of the 64 hours off in lieu of holidays per fiscal year that are integrated into the

employee's regular work schedule.)

5. The scheduling of work days off in lieu of holidays with pay shall be controlled by the Chief
of Police.

ARTICLE 32

HOLIDAY PREMIUM PAY

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, employees who are assigned to duty on July 4, December
25, January | and/or Labor Day (first Monday in September) of a calendar year shall be
compensated in cash at a rate of one and one-half (11%) their base salary for all such assigned
duty worked from 12:00 a.m. through 11:59 p.m., inclusive, during such days.

2. An employee may elect to receive such holiday compensation in compensatory time off in

lieu of cash, subject to the following terms and conditions:
a. The employee's compensatory time off balance (CTB) recorded on the most current

Police Department Personnel Status Report must be less than 225 hours;

b. Compensatory time off earned by an employee on a holiday listed above shall be
included in his/her CTB;
c. The procedures governing the use of compensatory time off earned on holidays shall

be the same as those provided in the OVERTIME Article of this Agreement for use
of compensatory time off; and

d. An employee may elect to receive compensatory time off in lieu of cash for work
performed during roll-call time on a holiday listed above, only if he/she
electecompensatory time off for all roll-call time worked during the Pay Period in
which the holiday occurred (this is consistent with existing Departmental procedures
governing eligibility for election of compensatory time off for roll-call time
overtime).

For administrative purposes, all time so worked shall be computed to the nearest 0.1 of an

hour. For purposes of interpretation and construction of this Article, the compensation

herein provided shall only be granted for authorized duty occurring on the actual calendar

dates that the four (4) holidays listed above fall; no such compensation will be granted for

duty on any other calendar date on which these four (4) holidays may officially be

celebrated or observed pursuant to law.

Application of the provisions enumerated herein shall not involve pyramiding of the

compensation described herein. No employee shall receive overtime benefits and/or shift or

weekend differential benefits in addition to holiday premium pay.

Any payment made in addition to the employee's base salary under the provisions of this

Article shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall such payments be

included in determining pension benefits or other fringe benefits.

1.

In the event of a layoff of members of the bargaining unit, the order of layoff shall be
inversely related to length of service. (The last employee hired shall be the first employee
laid off).

In the event of a recall to work, the order of return shall be directly related to length of
service. (The last employee laid off shall be the first employee returned to work).

Length of service, for the purpose of this Article, is to be measured from the date of original
hire in the Police Department with police powers.

Should the City find it necessary to lay off members of the bargaining unit, it shall give the
Association notice not less than four (4) weeks prior to the effective date of the layoff of the
initially affected employee. The City and the Association shall meet within three (3)
working days of the notice to discuss layoffs. The City at this meeting shall provide the
Association with a current seniority list of the Police Department.

Seniority shall be broken if an employee:

Retires

Resigns from the police service

Is discharged and the discharge is not reversed

Is not recalled from layoff for a period of three (3) years

Is recalled from a layoff and does not report for work within three (3) calendar weeks
Does not return at the expiration of a leave of absence.

ARTICLE 42

AGENCY SHOP

1.

The City agrees to allow the Association an "Agency Shop," as permitted by the provisions

of Section 111.70 (h) of the Wisconsin Statutes.

No member of the bargaining unit is required to join the Association. However,

membership in the Association is open to all members of the bargaining unit who choose to

join and comply with the constitution and by-laws of the Association. No person will be

denied membership in the Association because of race, ethnic origin, sex or religious

affiliation.

As a condition of continuing employment, all members of the bargaining unit shall bear their

fair share of the costs of collective bargaining by paying to the Association a monthly sum

equal to the regular monthly dues of members of the Association.

The City will deduct dues payments of Association members and fair-share payments of

non-members from their bi-weekly paycheck and remit these sums to the Association

Treasurer within ten (10) calendar days after the payday from which the deduction was

made.

Dues or fair-share deductions for new employees in the Association bargaining unit will be

made from their first paycheck.

The City will not deduct the dues of any employee in a two-week pay period unless the

employee is a member of the Association bargaining unit for at least seven calendar days in

such pay period.

Changes in dues or fair-share amounts to be deducted shall be certified by the Association to

the City Labor Negotiator at least four (4) weeks before the start of the pay period the

City, its officers, agents and employees against any and all claims, suits, actions or liability
of judgments for damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees
and disbursements of the City, if any) arising from any objections to or contesting of the
validity of any dues or fair-share deductions or the interpretation, application or

enforcement of this provision.

The Association will fully and fairly represent all members of the bargaining unit regardless
of whether they are members of the Association.

The City reserves the right to stop, withhold, or modify dues deductions for employees or
positions in question until resolved by mutual agreement or by the Wisconsin Employment

Relations Commission.

subsection 2. of the WAIVER OF FURTHER BARGAINING Article of this Agreement
shall not apply.

Employees may authorize the City to deduct Association dues from their paychecks by
executing an authorization card, such authorization card prescribed by the City, and
submitting it to a City-designated administrator.

of employee dues deduction that is uniformly required of all employees represented by the

start of the pay period the new uniform dues deduction schedule is to become effective.

An employee newly appointed to City employment on or after the execution date of this
Agreement may authorize the City to deduct Association initiation dues from his/her
paycheck by executing an authorization card prescribed by the City for this purpose and
submitting it to a City-designated administrator within 60 calendar days following his/her
appointment date. Initiation dues check-off shall become effective with the third pay period
following the date the authorization card is received by the City administrator and shall be
made in four (4) equal installments spread over four (4) pay periods. Once authorized, an
employee may not withdraw from the check-off except for separation from active service.
The Association shall file a report with the City Comptroller's Office certifying the amount
of employee initiation dues that are uniformly required of all new employees represented by

upon his/her return to the Police Department, he/she be permitted to count time spent as a
Police Liaison Officer for the sole purpose of meeting the length of service requirements
when qualifying to take promotional exams. A Police Liaison Officer who meets the
qualifications established for a promotional exam may take such exam while he/she is a
Police Liaison Officer. In the event a Police Liaison Officer is nominated by the Chief of
Police for promotion while a Police Liaison Officer and he/she wishes to accept the

Police Liaison Officer's name shall be removed from the eligible list and he/she shall not be
eligible to be promoted from that list.

Except as specifically provided otherwise herein, all costs associated with a Police Liaison
Officer shall be borne by the Association and under no circumstances shall the City be

Allowance benefit for that calendar month; such an employee shall be termed an "eligible
employee." The City shall reimburse an eligible employee the basic/general parking rate in

of any change that the City may from time to time make in this list at least sixty (60)
calendar days prior to the effective date of such change. Eligible employees shall be entitled
to receive either a Regular Parking Allowance benefit under the terms and conditions
hereinafter provided:
a. Regular Parking Allowance Benefit
In order to receive a Regular Parking Allowance benefit for a calendar month, an
eligible employee must purchase a monthly parking permit for that month from a

deemed acceptable to the Department, whenever the employee must retain the permit

in order to receive parking benefits) by indicating his/her signature and payroll

number on the portion of his/her monthly parking permit he/she receives from the
vendor and submit the endorsed permit (or acceptable permit stub/receipt) to the
Police Department Administration no later than the 15th day of the calendar month
covered by the monthly permit (i.e., the 15th of April for the month of April).
Following the Department's receipt of the endorsed permit (or acceptable permit
stub/receipt), the employee shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of the current
parking rate at the time of reimbursement.
Payments provided hereunder shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the
close of the calendar month covered by the permit. Except as provided in subsection 3,
below, only approved parking facilities’ monthly parking permits that are properly endorsed
shall be covered by the benefits provided herein. 3. The Association
recognizes that there are a limited number of parking spaces available at City approved
parking facilities; accordingly, monthly parking permits for these spaces will be sold to
eligible employees on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to their availability. During a
calendar month when no monthly parking permit at any City-approved parking facility(ies)
is(are) available because the vendor(s) has(have) determined that no space is available, the
City will honor monthly parking permit receipts from parking facilities not on the City-
approved list that are within the geographic area bounded by Michigan Avenue on the
south, North 12th Street on the west, West Juneau Avenue on the north and North Van
Buren Street on the east. The employee shall endorse the receipt by indicating his/her
signature and payroll number on the monthly parking permit receipt and shall submit the
endorsed parking permit receipt to the Police Department Administration no later than the

Daily Parking Receipts

During a calendar month when no monthly parking permit is available to an employee under
the provisions of either paragraph 2 or 3, hereof, because no space is available, the City will
honor daily parking receipts from parking facilities within the geographic area described in
paragraph 3, hereof, subject to the employee submitting a form prescribed by the
Department to the Police Department Administration within five consecutive calendar days

following the close of the calendar month. The form shall contain the following

information:

the calendar month plainly indicated; and
c. All of the daily receipts for the calendar month stapled to the back of the form.
Following submission of the prescribed Departmental form to the Police Department
Administration, the employee shall be entitled to receive a monthly parking benefit for the
calendar month covered by the daily parking receipts. Such benefit shall be in lieu of the
monthly parking benefits provided under paragraphs 2 and 3.
No employee shall be eligible for the parking benefits provided by the Parking During Court
Overtime Appearance paragraph of this Agreement for a calendar month for which he/she
receives benefits hereunder.

computation establishing pension benefits or payments.

The City shall be held harmless against any and all claims, actions and lawsuits relating to
theft or personal property damage brought against the City by employees using parking
facilities pursuant to the parking allowance benefits provided herein. The City shall be held
harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, actions, damages and judgments due to the

ARTICLE 63

DRUG TESTING
MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT DRUG TESTING POLICY STATEMENT

The Milwaukee Police Department is charged with enforcing all laws and ordinances and
with maintaining a safe and peaceful community. The pervasive risk of harm caused by
drug trafficking and illegal drug use by members of the Police Department creates a clear
and present danger to the safety of the public and fellow law enforcement officers. The
illegal use of drugs cannot and will not be tolerated within the Milwaukee Police
Department. The law enforcement profession has several uniquely compelling interests that
justify the use of employee drug testing. The public has the right to expect that those who
are sworn to protect them are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to assume
these duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of controlled substances
and other forms of drug abuse can seriously impair an employee's physical and mental

health, and thus, job performance. Where law enforcement officers participate in illegal

drug use and drug activity, the integrity of the law enforcement profession and public
confidence in that integrity is destroyed. This confidence is further eroded by the potential
for corruption created by drug use.

Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the Milwaukee Police Department and to
preserve public trust and confidence in a fit and drug free law enforcement profession, the
Department shall implement an expanded drug testing program to detect illegal drug use by
sworn employees. Officers of all ranks will be randomly tested in such numbers as to ensure
that a credible deterrent exists to illegal drug use.

MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT DRUG TESTING PROGRAM

(Provisions applicable to MPA-represented Department Members)

DRUG TESTING PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

A. The term "Department" as used herein shall mean the Milwaukee Police Department.

The term "member" shall mean a Department employee in the WERC - certified
Department bargaining unit represented by the MPA.
B. Members shall be subject to drug testing under the following circumstances:
1. | Where facts or circumstances are sufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion
that a Department member is illegally using drugs.
NOTE Reasonable Suspicion exists when evidence or information which
appears reliable is known to the police supervisor and is of such weight and
persuasiveness as to make the supervisor, based upon/his/her personal
judgment and experience, reasonably suspect that member of the department is
illegally using drugs. A reasonable suspicion that a member is illegally using
drugs must be supported by specific articulable facts from which rational
inference may be drawn. Reasonable suspicion cannot be based upon mere
"hunch" or solely upon poor work performance. If suspicion of drug use is
based upon observation of the suspected member's physical appearance, at

least two (2) supervisors must make observations.

Whenever a member is directly involved in an incident that results in death, or

great bodily harm as defined by State Statute.

Whenever a member is on probation, the member shall be tested prior to

completion of the member's probation period. Completion of the member's

probation period shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.

Whenever a member is eligible for promotion (including reclassifications), the

member shall be tested prior to promotion. Promotion shall be contingent

upon passing the drug test.

Whenever a member is returning from a leave of absence that exceeds 90

consecutive calendar days in duration. Reinstatement to the Department from

the leave of absence shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.

Random Drug Testing

a. Periodically a list of Department members selected for drug testing shall
be generated by an independent secure random selection process. The
frequency of random testing, and sampling rate, shall be as prescribed
from time to time by the Chief of Police. The independent agency
providing the random selection process shall be prescribed by the Chief.
Such independent agency shall be provided with a list of all Department
members covered by random drug testing encoded so that only the Chief
of Police and the Commanding Officer of the Professional Performance
Division know the identity of the Department members.

b. | The Chief may increase the frequency of random testing, and sampling
rate over and above the frequency of random testing and sampling rate
he prescribes from time to time under paragraph 6.a., hereof, for
members assigned to the following Department Units: Vice Control
Division, Tactical Enforcement Unit, Property Control Section (only

those persons directly involved in the custody and handling of illegal

drugs), Professional Performance Division and, the Intelligence
Division. If subsequent Departmental reorganization results in
modifications to any of these units, the function performed by a unit as it
is presently constituted, shall continue to be covered hereunder no matter
how such unit is constituted following a future reorganization.
Members selected to be tested shall be notified by their Commanding
Officer, who shall give them a written order to report for testing. A copy
of such written order shall not be entered into a member's personnel file,
but shall be retained by the Department in a file kept at the Professional
Performance Division.
All members on paid leave who are selected for drug testing pursuant to
paragraphs 6.a. or 6.b., hereof, shall not be required to participate in such
test, except those members having the following status as of the notice of
selection:
(1) Members on sick or injury leave who have received permission to
leave the residence to further recuperation;
(2) Members on compensatory time off authorized after the selection
notice; or
(3) Members on "suspended with pay" or "dismissed with pay pending
appeal" status.
Members on regular off days shall not be subject to random drug testing.
Any member selected for testing who claims inability to participate due
to medical reason shall be examined by a physician designated by the
Chief. The physician shall determine if such member may be excused
from the test. If such member is excused from a scheduled test, he/she
shall be rescheduled for testing as soon as possible, irrespective of any

random sampling selection.

shall be subject to drug testing upon entering and leaving these assignments, as

well as on an annual basis while serving in such assignments.

Refusal to submit to a drug test shall result in immediate suspension and discipline

up to and including dismissal from the Department. Attempts to alter or substitute a

test sample provided by the member being tested shall be deemed a refusal to submit

to a drug test. When the member appears unable to give a specimen at the time of

the test, testing personnel shall document the circumstances on the drug-test report

form. The member shall be permitted no more than three (3) hours to give a sample,

during which time he/she shall remain in the testing area, under observation.

Reasonable amounts of water may be given to the employee to encourage urination.

Failure to submit a sample shall be considered a refusal to submit a drug test.

Testing Procedure

1.

The current testing procedure shall be continued. This procedure is currently
administered by Aurora Consolidated Laboratories. Nothing herein shall
prohibit the Chief of Police from changing the provider of this procedure, so
long as the new provider is DHHS-certified and performs the procedure
pursuant to DHSS standards.

Substances to be tested for include:

Amphetamines Opiates
Canabinoids Phencyclidine (PCP)
Cocaine

Nothing herein shall prohibit the Chief of Police from amending this list of
substances, so long as the added substance is one for which DHHS has adopted
a quantitative standard for a positive test finding for the substance; the
Department will notify the MPA of amendments to this list of substances.

Split Samples

At the collection site, the technician shall either collect the specimen in two

147
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

containers or shall collect the specimen in one container and shall then split the
specimen into two containers. One sample (the primary sample) shall be tested
by the City-designated testing laboratory. The other sample (the split sample)
shall be stored by the testing laboratory should a verified confirmed positive
result from the test of the first sample.

If a verified, confirmed positive result is obtained from the test of the primary
sample, the member shall be informed that he/she has 72 hours to notify the
Medical Review Officer (MRO) that he/she wishes to challenge the test result
by means of independent testing of the split sample. The member must so
notify the MRO in writing within 72 hours of the member's being notified that
his/her test was verified confirmed positive for the presence of a drug. Upon
such a challenge, the split sample retained by the testing laboratory for use by
the member shall be forwarded by the testing laboratory to a DHHS-certified
laboratory selected by the member from a list of four such laboratories
designated by the City.

All costs associated with the testing of the split sample shall be borne by
the member, provided however, if the test of the split sample does not indicate
a positive drug test result, then the Department shall reimburse such member
for the costs of testing the split sample. Testing of split samples shall be
conducted pursuant to the retesting provision described in the Federal
Guidelines.

All test results shall be reviewed and interpreted by a Medical Review Officer
(MRO) who shall be a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse
disorders, designated by the Chief. The MRO shall examine alternative
medical explanations for any confirmed positive test result. This action may
include conducting a medical interview with the individual, review of the

individual's medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical

148
Cm nN Dn Fw NY eS

RY NY YK NR KY KN Se eee ee Be ewe ee
QA DA AK YW H fF SO we ADH Fw KH KF SD

factors. The MRO shall review all medical records made available by the
tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have resulted from
legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall forward the results of his/her
review to Chief of Police and/or Commanding Officer of the Professional

Performance Division.

Il. ACCESS TO TEST RESULTS

Confirmed positive drug test results verified by the MRO shall be made available only to the

following:

Chief of Police

Commanding Officer of the Professional Performance Division

If. ADMINISTRATION/DISCIPLINARY ACTION

A.

A member, who has been ordered to take and has taken, a drug test based on either
reasonable suspicion, or the requirements of paragraph I.B.2., hereof, shall not be
subject to disciplinary action until the test results are received by the Department.
During that period, however, the member may be required to surrender his/her
weapon, badge, I.D. card, cap shield, and callbox key, and may be suspended with
pay. This action shall be accomplished most discreetly and, whenever possible,
without advising other personnel of the reasons.

All discipline involving a member who has a confirmed positive test for illegal drug
use, verified by the MRO, shall be administered by the Chief; such discipline may
include dismissal from the Department. A challenge to a confirmed positive test
result by a member shall not affect or delay the effective date of discipline imposed
against the member pursuant to this section. The Department's position is that any
member proven to have illegally used drugs should be dismissed for such use,
subject only to the discretion of the Chief and review of the Fire and Police

Commission.

EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM

1.

2.

At his or her discretion, the Chief of Police may establish an Early Intervention Program
(EIP) for the Milwaukee Police Department.

The City formed an EIP Advisory Group prior to implementation of the EIP. The EIP

160
Cord ank wn ee

WwW WwWWWwW HNN NY NNNNNN Eee eee Be eee
ARON FSTOAADAARKHBNKF TOCA ADUNUBR WHR OS

Advisory Group included one representative from the MPA, MPSO, and ALEASP. The
Chief also appointed representatives to the Advisory Group. The purpose of the EIP
Advisory Group was to consider appropriate performance measurements and benchmarks
for the identification of employees whose performance indicates a need for intervention.
The EIP Advisory Group may make recommendations concerning performance
measurements and intervention benchmarks to the Chief. However, such
recommendations shall be advisory only. The Chief shall give due consideration to any
such recommendations. The Chief shall decide when the Advisory Group
recommendations are due.

The EIP is a management tool designed for multiple purposes, including, but not limited
to, evaluation of employees, identification of training or re-training needs and for referral
to the City of Milwaukee Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or to another outside

confidential counseling service.

a. If an employee is identified through any EIP analysis, the mere fact that he or she
was identified by the EIP shall not be used in the employee’s evaluation;
however, the data which led to the employee being identified by the EIP may be
used in the employee’s evaluation.

b. If the EJP analysis indicates a need for training or re-training, the employee shall
be required to participate in all training or re-training deemed appropriate by the
Chief.

c. An employee who is referred to the EAP or to an outside confidential

AND

THE NEGOTIATING TEAM FOR THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE

The parties agree to amend subsection 3.c.(1) of the OVERTIME Article set forth in the

1983-1984 City/Milwaukee Police Association Memorandum of Understanding so that in the

1983-1984 City/MPA Labor Contract it will read as follows:

“D)

If an employee’s compensatory time off balance (CTB), including any remaining
unused compensatory time off earned prior to September 11, 1983, recorded on
the most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is less than 32 hours,
the employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of cash for each
instance of overtime work performed after issuance of the most current Status
Report until issuance of the next Status Report which indicates the employee’s

CTB is equal to or greater than 32 hours.”

The parties further agree that with respect to authorized overtime assignments directly

related to the Milwaukee Police Department Band function, the following provisions shall be

applicable:

Notwithstanding the OVERTIME Article of the 1983-1984 Labor Contract
between the City of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Police Association, when an
employee is a member of the Milwaukee Police Department Band and performs
an authorized overtime assignment directly related to the Band function, he/she
shall be compensated at base salary rates (IX) in compensatory time off for the

duration of such overtime assignment. The time off so earned: Shall not count

instead of cash, that is provided for in subsection 3.c.(1) of the OVERTIME
Article; Shall not affect the employee’s CTB recorded on Police Department
Personnel Status Reports; and shall not be included in the cash buyout provided
for under subsection 3.d.(1) of the OVERTIME Article.

2. An employee may use earned time off from authorized overtime assignments
directly related to the Police Band function on dates he/she has requested
provided the employee gives his/her commanding officer reasonable advance
notice of the dates requested and the dates are determined available by the
commanding officer in accordance with the needs of the Police Service. The
processing of requests for use of compensatory time off shall be on a first-come,
first-served basis. Decisions made by employee’s commanding officer with
respect to the availability of the dates the employee has requested shall be final.

3. Administration of Band Overtime shall be in accordance with Departmental Order
#7386, dated February 17, 1977, and attached herewith as Appendix A.

The parties further agree that for purposes of administering the benefits provided by

aforesaid OVERTIME Article (as amended, above) the following provisions shall apply:

1.

Except as provided in subsection 2, of this paragraph, below, the Police Department
Personnel Status Report used to determine an employee’s eligibility to elect compensatory
time off instead of cash for an instance of overtime work performed shall cover overtime
work performed during the 336 consecutive hour time period beginning at 12:01 a.m. on
the second Wednesday of the pay period closest to the date on which the Status Report is
issued. Normally, the Status Report would be issued on the second Wednesday of the pay
period; in the event the Status Report is delayed, it shall be deemed effective retroactive

to 12:01 a.m. on that Wednesday.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN
THE MILWAUKEE POLICE ASSOCIATION, LOCAL # 21
L.U.P.A., AFL-CIO

AND
THE NEGOTATING TEAM FOR THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE

For purposes of interpretation and construction of the free parking provisions provided
for in the 1983-1984 City/MPA labor contract (Article 17, subsection 2.a.(4)), an employee shall
be covered by such provisions when performing the following authorized overtime assignments,
notwithstanding the fact that such assignments do not fall within the ambit of court overtime

1. An employee assigned to the First District, or a Bureau located at the Police
Administration Building, required to meet with the First District Captain at the
Administration Building to discuss a tavern violation matter.

2. An employee required to report to the Lieutenant in charge of the Traffic
Accident office of the Traffic Bureau to discuss an accident investigation matter.

3. An employee required to report to the Captain of the Vice Squad on a matter
involving a previously executed search warrant.

In the above 3 enumerated circumstances the employee shall not be entitled to court
overtime, instead he/she shall submit an overtime card indicating a performance measure number
determined by the Police Department Administration.

The aforesaid free parking provisions shall also be interpreted and construed to cover an
employee subpoenaed to court on authorized Departmental business during a period the
employee is on approval sick or injury leave; such coverage shall be limited to the duration of
the court appearance resulting from the subpoena and the employee shall not be entitled to

overtime benefits for such appearance.

187

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

TUPA, AFL-CI
AND
THE NEGOTIATING TEAM FOR THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE

The parties hereto agree that for purposes of interpretation and construction of the

provisions of subsection 3.c. of the OVERTIME Article of the current City/MPA labor contract,

in respect to administration of negative compensatory time off balances, the following shall

apply from and after December 19, 1983:

1.

Subject to the requirements governing usage of compensatory time off provided
for in subsection 3.c.(2) of such OVERTIME Article, an employee may use
compensatory time off so long as his/her compensatory time off balance (CTB)
recorded on the most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is not
less than zero (0) hours, notwithstanding the fact that such usage may result in the
employee having a negative CTB on the next following status report.

An employee with a negative CTB recorded on the most current Police
Department Personnel Status Report shall have an amount equal to the cash value
of his/her negative CTB deducted from the paycheck he/she receives for the Pay
Period next following the Pay Period of the status report recording such negative
CTB. The cash value of an employee’s negative CTB shall be computed on the
basis of his/her hourly base pay rate in effect during the Pay Period in which such
negative CTB occurs as this rate is established under the BASE SALARY Article
of the City/MPA Labor Contract in effect at that time.

An employee may not use time off which he/she has earned, such as vacation and

holiday time or compensatory time off earned following publication of a Police

Department Personnel Status Report indicating a negative CTB for the employee,
to offset a negative CTB and thereby avoid the paycheck deduction provided for
in subsection 2, above.

4. In disputes over an employee’s negative CTB, the compensatory time off taken
and earned that is indicated on his/her time card (in the case of compensatory time
off earned other than for roll-call, the time off earned indicated on the employee’s
overtime Tab Card—Form PO-7) for the Pay Period of the Police Department
Personnel Status Report on which the disputed negative CTB was recorded, shall
decide the dispute.

The parties further agree that all other terms and conditions of such OVERTIME Article

shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

IUPA, AFL-CIO
AND
THE NEGOTIATING TEAM FOR THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE

The parties hereto agree that whenever the Police Department Personnel Status Report for
a pay period indicates a deficit in the time off entitlement of an employee because he/she has:

qd) Exceeded his/her annual HOLIDAY OFF entitlement; and/or
(2) Exceeded his/her annual VACATION entitlement; and/or
(3) Exceeded his/her INJURY PAY entitlement; and/or

(4) A negative SICK LEAVE BALANCE,

the Police Department Administration shall deduct unused time off in the employee’s accounts
indicated on such status report that are not in deficit by an amount of time off up to the time off
that offsets, hour for hour, the employee’s time off deficit unless the employee notifies the Police
Department Administration prior to 3 p.m. on the Friday immediately following the date such
status report is issued that he/she does not want the offset made; such notification shall be
provided in accordance with Departmental procedures established for this purpose. If such
notification is provided the offset will not be made and the deficit will be docked from the
employee’s paycheck for the pay period of the status report (the amount of such deficit to be
computed on the basis of the employee’s hourly base salary rate in effect during such pay
period). If there is no unused time off in the employee’s accounts indicated on such status report
that are not in deficit, or if the amount of such unused time off is insufficient to offset the
employee’s time off deficit, the remaining deficit will be docked from the employee’s paycheck

on the same basis as is provided above when the notification requirements are met; and

The following paragraphs from the Pension Benefits Article of the 1985-1986City/Association

Agreement are included for informational purposes:

1.

Employees who are entitled to service credit during calendar years 1979 through
1986, inclusive, under either the Employee's Retirement System of Milwaukee or
Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Milwaukee pension plans, shall receive
such service credit at the rate of 2.5% per annum of Final Average Salary for each
such year or part thereof.

Whenever the ERS Act provides that a medical panel make a determination affecting
an employee's eligibility for benefits thereunder, a panel shall be substituted therefore
consisting of three (3) physicians, one physician to be designated by the Association,
one physician to be designated by the Employe Benefits Administrator and the third
physician to be selected by agreement of the other two physicians. The panel may
refer a member it is examining to an outside physician for examination. Decisions
made by the panel on matters which are properly before it shall be by majority action
and shall not be subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure provisions of this
Agreement. All costs associated with the panel, including costs of outside physicians
used by the panel in making its determinations, shall be provided for by funds
appropriated for that purpose from the budget of the City Annuity and Pension Board.
Effective January 1, 1985, for employees in active service on or after that date and
who are members of the Policemen's Survivorship Fund of the Employees’
Retirement System of Milwaukee, an increase in the current $200/$400 monthly
survivorship benefits to $300/$600 per month, under the same terms and conditions
applicable to such current benefits. This increase is being granted because there is no

added cost, but if the experience is adverse, the benefits are to be reduced so as not to

195

increase cost. All other terms and conditions of survivorship benefits shall remain

unchanged.

4. An employee who files an application for a duty disability retirement allowance with

the ERS Board on or after August 1, 1985, shall not be eligible to continue to receive
such allowance beyond the first of the month next following their 57th birthday; on
and after the first of the month next following their 57th birthday, such an employee
shall receive the service retirement allowance to which he/she would be entitled upon
normal retirement at age 57 and he/she shall have the time spent receiving such duty
disability retirement allowance included as creditable service for purposes of
determining his/her service retirement allowance. The City will hold the Association
harmless from claims and actions against the Association based upon this subsection
and any ordinance or administrative action implementing this subsection, and the
Association does hereby agree to tender the defense of any such claim to the City
forthwith.

5. An employee appointed to the Police Officer position classification on or after August
1, 1985, shall not be entitled to receive a duty disability retirement allowance for any
injury he/she may sustain while on duty prior to the start of field training during the
period of time he/she is assigned to the Police Academy for recruit training, including
any subsequent injury related to the injury sustained during recruit training. Such an
employee shall instead be covered by State of Wisconsin Workers' Compensation Act
benefits during such period and shall be subject to all provisions pertaining to such
Act.

6. Effective January 1, 1985, for employees in active service on or after that date:

a. Whenever the Annuity and Pension Board of the Employees’ Retirement
System of Milwaukee grants a disability retirement allowance to an employee

b. If an employee, who becomes eligible to receive an ordinary disability
retirement allowance under the provisions of Section 36.05(2) of the ERS Act
on or after January 1, 1985, elects an optional benefit provided for under
36.05(7)(b) of the ERS Act, the option so elected shall become effective on
the employee's effective date of ordinary disability retirement as determined
under Section 36.05(2) of the ERS Act.

c. If an employee, who has attained the minimum service retirement age, elects
an optional benefit provided for under Subsection 36.05(7)(b) of the ERS Act
on or after January 1, 1985, the option so elected shall become effective on the
employee's effective date of retirement determined under Subsection
36.05(1)(a) of the ERS Act.

An employee in active service on or after January 1, 1985, who is a member of the
Employees' Retirement System of Milwaukee (ERS) and who has not attained the
minimum normal retirement age and service requirements provided for in Sections
36.05(1)(b) or 36.05(1)(f) of the ERS Act shall be permitted to elect a protective
survivorship option for his/her spouse under Section 36.05(7)(b)4 of the ERS Act to
become effective upon his/her death provided the employee makes such election six
months prior to the date upon which he/she first attained 25 years of creditable
service as a "Policeman." Such election shall be irrevocable, but shall be
automatically revoked in the event the surviving spouse pre-deceases the employee
before retirement or the surviving spouse is legally divorced from the employee
before retirement. If elected, the coverage under such option shall become effective
on the date the employee would have first attained age 52. In the event the employee
has not attained the aforesaid minimum normal retirement requirements, but has at

least 25 years of creditable service as a "Policeman," then such employee shall have

until six months following the execution date of this Agreement to elect such option;
if elected, the coverage under such option shall become effective on the date of

spouse entitled to receive benefits under the provisions of Section 36.05(5) of the
ERS Act. The term, "Policeman," shall be as defined under Section 36.02 of the ERS
Act. All other provisions of 36.05(7)(b)4 of the ERS Act shall remain unchanged in
full force and effect.

Wisconsin Statutes, the provisions of Section 36.13(2) of the ERS Act shall not be
applicable to employees appointed to City employment on or after August 1, 1985.
Implementation of the foregoing paragraphs was accomplished by amendments to the City
Charter enacted prior to November 3, 1988. These amendments, together with the balance of
pension benefits applicable to employes' covered by this Agreement under the 1985-1986
City/Association Agreement, are referenced in the introductory paragraph of the Pension

Framework for a
Memorandum of Understanding

Between the City of Milwaukee
And the Milwaukee Police Association
Local #21 I.U.P.A., AFL-CIO

Re: Discretionary Days Off in Lieu of Discipline

Overview

The current disciplinary system within the Milwaukee Police Department frequently results in
varying periods of unpaid suspension leave for employees. In essence employees are found
guilty of violations of departmental rules and regulations and the Chief of Police Head makes a
determination as to appropriate penalty. Upon Order of the Chief of Police, employees may be
subjected to periods of unpaid suspension of one or more days in length. In such events the
disciplined member is suspended for specific date(s) as determined by the Professional
Performance Division, and said member suffers a financial loss for the unpaid date(s). It is
recognized that financial losses are not typically borne by the offending member alone, but by
his or her family as well. Additionally, members on paid suspension periods are absent from
duty and therefore the Police Department suffers the loss of human resources. It is the intent of
this agreement to provide for a suitable alternative to the current system, which will alleviate
much of the financial loss to employees and their families, keep productive employees at their
workplaces and still provide an effective means of discipline. This shall be accomplished by
allowing Police Department members, under the below conditions, to substitute discretionary off

time in place of suspension days.

Procedure

In those discipline cases wherein the Chief of Police orders the suspension of a member for a
period of five days or less, the member subject to said discipline shall be served with the
discipline order(s) consistent with current practices. In addition, the member shall also be served
with a notice informing them of their option to substitute discretionary time in place of any or all
suspension days. The notice shall advise the member that if he or she wishes to substitute

206
CamordtanekwWnN ee

WwW WwW Ww YHYNYNNNNNNY SR See ee eee
ABRONFSTOAAAARKHNHKF SOMA AIADAUNUKRYWNHRE SDS

discretionary time, he or she must notify the Personnel Division in writing within five calendar

days. Upon proper notification, the Personnel Division shall process the member’s request and

subtract the appropriate discretionary time from the member’s balance. Failure to properly

notify the Personnel Division or Administrator within the five-day period shall automatically

result in the member forfeiting their ability to substitute discretionary time and the suspension

shall proceed as ordered by the Chief.

Conditions of Agreement

For applicable suspension as described above, the substitution of discretionary time shall

be at the member’s sole discretion, given that the member has the time available.

Suspensions exceeding five days shall not be eligible for substitution.

Only vacation days may be substituted. Substitutions shall be on a one-for-one basis, i.e.

one vacation day replaces one suspension day.

Compensatory time, sick time, etc., may not be utilized for substitution.

Members may choose to substitute discretionary time for all or part of a suspension

period. However, substitutions may only be made in full eight-hour blocks.

Members may only substitute discretionary time that is available on the current Time

Owed and Allowed reports. Members may not “borrow” future time.

In the event that a member chooses not to substitute discretionary time, or does not have

the time available to them on the current Time Owed and Allowed report, said member

shall serve the suspension days as ordered by the Chief.

A member’s decision to substitute discretionary time shall have no bearing on their

disciplinary record. All official Police Department disciplinary records, including the

Personnel Order, shall continue to indicate that the member was suspended for the time

period as ordered. Substituted suspension time shall continue to be a factor in matters

such as progressive discipline, Sick Leave Incentive, promotional exams, etc.

A member’s decision to substitute discretionary time is neither an admission of guilt nor

a waiver of grievance/appeal rights.

In the event that a member chooses to substitute discretionary time and then is awarded a

reduction of discipline through the grievance/appeal process, said member shall be

credited with the awarded day(s), to the same account from which they were drawn.

Time credited to the member’s balance shall be governed by the rules in place for

discretionary time applicable to the date the time is returned. For example: In January of

2005, a member is suspended for two days and substitutes two vacation days. The

member grieves the discipline and in January of 2006, an arbitrator reduces the discipline
207
 

1 to one day. The Police Department would then add eight hours to the member’s vacation
2 balance for year 2006 and subsequently the eight hours would have to be utilized by the
3 end of that calendar year, unless the arbitrator/umpire directs otherwise.
4 e For purposes of this memorandum of understanding, the parties recognize the authority of
5 the arbitrator/umpire to direct that the member be able to utilize any returned time during
6 a period of one year immediately following the date of the award.
7 e The Chief of Police shall not in any way consider a member’s discretionary off-time
8 balance when deciding upon discipline.
9 e The procedure would be implemented on a trial basis for the term of the 2007-2009

10 Agreement and could be extended beyond that date by mutual agreement.
