schedule shall be established between the employee and the City.

DRUG TESTING
Authority for Testing. Only Chief Officers may order a drug test.

Conditions Allowing for Testing. Employees may be subjected to
drug testing if the City has a reasonable suspicion that the
employee is using (1) illegal drugs; (2) prescription drugs without
or contrary to a prescription; or (3) alcohol on duty (except in small
amounts used in cooking).

Reasonable suspicion shall mean an articulable and specific state of
facts and/or circumstances which would lead a reasonable person
to believe an individual was using unlawful drugs/narcotics,
alcohol, or prescription drugs without or contrary to a prescription.

No information or knowledge obtained through application of this
policy/procedure may be used for other than administrative

purposes.

Testing procedures shall:

1. Positively identify employees prior to testing.

2. Provide for employee privacy and security of samples,

3. Establish any drugs being taken legitimately (e.g. under
medical supervision).

4. Develop a two-step test. Any specimen testing positive in
the urinalysis shall be subject to confirmation by a second
test using a different technology. No notification shall be
given of initial positive tests until confirmation by the
second test has been completed and is positive. At the time
the samples are drawn, a second set of samples shall be
taken and sealed. Should the original samples show
positive, the second sealed set of samples shall be retained
for six months to allow for further testing in the event of
dispute.

5. The laboratory selected to conduct the analysis must be

experienced and capable of quality control, documentation,
chain of custody, technical expertise and demonstrated
