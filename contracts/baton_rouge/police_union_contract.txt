10-Less than 15 168
15 or more yrs. 192

UNPAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE, MILITARY LEAVE AND SEVERANCE PAY

A. Employees shall be entitled to leave of absence in case

B. An Employee shall be eligible for sick leave as it is
accrued and will be required to notify a supervisor one (1) hour
prior to the start of his duty assignment when sick leave is to
be taken. When sick leave has been taken, a certificate stating
the cause of absence and the amount of time taken shall be filed
with the appointing authority. Sick leave is provided in the
event absence from duty is necessary because of (1) a bona fide
illness or injury of an employee, (2) the pregnancy of an
employee which prevents performance of assigned duties, and (3
exposure of an employee to a contagious disease.

The parties recognize that sick leave is intended for use
only when an employee is unable to work due to the circumstances
described above, and that application for sick leave under other
circumstances is an abuse. The parties further recognize the
City's legitimate need to verify that an employee who applies for
sick leave is eligible. Therefore the following procedures shall

apply:

1) Discretionary Requirements. The City may at any time
require an employee to provide a doctor's certificate;

provided, that the City must notify the employee that it
will require a doctor's certificate before the employee
returns to work so the employee may see a doctor while he or
she is still sick or injured.

17
2) Automatic Requirements. An employee shall
automatically be required to provide a doctor’s certificate
when he requests sick leave beyond the first 70 hours of
sick leave in any calendar year; provided, that if an
employee provides a doctor’s certificate for any or all of
the first 70 hours, then the hours covered by such
certificate shall not count against the 70 hours.

Through the quarter ending June 30, 2015, any employee
who uses no sick leave, terminal leave or worker’s
compensation leave during each quarter(January 1-March 31,
April 1- June 30, July 1- September 30, and October 1-
December 31) will receive a credit of the ten (10) hours of
compensatory leave at the end of each such quarter.

Effective July 1, 2015, Any employee who uses no sick
leave, terminal leave or worker’s compensation leave during
each six month period (January 1 - June 30 or July 1-
December 31) will receive a credit of the 15 hours of
compensatory leave at the end of each such period.

3) The Chief of Police or his designee may visit an
employee who is off on sick leave at their place of
confinement to ascertain that the sick leave is in
accordance with contract provisions and other applicable
sick leave rules.

4) Doctor's Certificate. Whenever an employee is required
or chooses to “provide a doctor's certificate,” this shall
mean that to be eligible for sick leave the employee must a)
present an original doctor’s certificate that he was
personally seen by, or personally consulted with the
physician or physician’s designee during the period for
which leave is requested and that in the doctor's medical
opinion he was unable to work in a full or temporary
restricted duty capacity and b) upon request of the Chief of
Police or his designee sign an authorization allowing the
City health care professionals to communicate with the
employee's doctor and obtain from him appropriate
information and records to verify the employee's inability
to work. The City's health care professional may disclose
such ‘communications only to the Chief of Police or his
designee, and shall otherwise keep the medical information

18
secured from the employee's doctor confidential, provided,
that if the employee contests the City's action in
administrative or court proceedings, the City's health care
professional may disclose his communication with the
employee's doctor to the Department or its counsel and to
the court, administrative agency or board.

5) Family Illness. Leave for illness of the employee’s
Family members shall be provided in accordance with the
Family and Medical Leave Rules of the Fire and Police Civil
Service Board.

Cc. For all employees who are employed prior to April 4,
2015, sick leave shall be earned in accordance with the following
schedule which is based upon continuous service.

Length of Service Hours/Year
Less than 3 yrs 96
3-Less than 5 120
5-Less than 10 144
10-Less than 15 168
15 or more yrs. 192

For all employees who are hired on or after April 4,
2015, sick leave shall be earned at an annual accrual rate of 96
hours per year. Such employees shall be allowed to accrue and
carry over to the following year a maximum of 480 hours of sick
leave.

D. Sick leave shall be accrued on a pay period basis and
