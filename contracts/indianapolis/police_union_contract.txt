F.O.P. and City Rights and Obligations

Section |. Recognition.

The City recognizes the F.O.P. as the exclusive bargaining representative for all merit
ranks of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (hereinafter "IMPD") for the purpose
of negotiating in good faith the terms and conditions of employment in the IMPD, provided such
recognition is conditioned on the terms as set forth in the Revised Code of the City of
Indianapolis-Marion County, ยง 291-601. The City shall not negotiate with, or make any
collective bargaining agreement or contract with any other employee group working in
classifications covered by this Agreement.

Section 2. F.O.P. Rights.

A. Dues Check-off.

Upon receipt of voluntary, written, current, signed authorization from employees in such
form as complies with the law of Indiana, who are covered by this Agreement and who are
members of the F.O.P., the City shall deduct each month from the earnings of each of said
employees an amount representing their regular monthly dues for the preceding month and shall
remit such monies together with the appropriate records to a designated F.O.P. official. The City
shall not be liable to the F.O.P. for failure to make deductions for dues. In the event of an

overcharge already remitted to the F.O.P., it shall be the responsibility of the F.O.P. alone to
adjust the matter with the employee. The City shall not make dues deductions for employees
covered by this Agreement on behalf of any other employee organization. The F.O.P. will
indemnify the City and hold it harmless from any or all claims or liabilities which may arise
under this paragraph.

Bi Bulletin Boards.

The F.O.P. shall have access to a portion of at least one bulletin board of its choice within
normal work areas of covered employees for the purpose of posting F.O.P. notices and other
F.O.P. materials. The F.O.P. portion of the bulletin board shall be identified with the name of the
Lodge and the F.O.P. may designate persons responsible for its utilization. The City reserves the
right, with notice to the F.O.P., to remove inappropriate materials.

c Access to Roll Call Sites.

The F.O.P. shall have access to attend roll call sites for the purpose of conveying F.O.P.
business to members of the Department after securing the approval of the Chief or his/her
designee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

D. Compensation for F.O.P. Business.

All F.O.P. business and activity shall be on an employee's own time and shall not be
compensated by the City except as specifically set forth below:

(i) A bank of 3000 hours per year will be furnished by the City for use by
IMPD officers as F.O.P. Pool Time. This time shall be used by IMPD
representatives on the F.O.P. Executive Board or their designees to
conduct business directly related to labor-management relations such as
the investigation and adjustment of grievances and educational activity
which the Department and the F.O.P. mutually agree is in the best interest
of the City and the F.O.P. F.O.P. Pool Time hours shall only be used by
F.0.P. representatives for business performed during their regularly
scheduled work hours. Employees properly charging hours against F.O.P.
Pool Time will be compensated at their regular rate of pay. Employees

must use a minimum of one (1) hour of Pool Time. After the first hour,
Pool Time may be taken in half (1/2) hour increments. To be eligible for
compensation under this subsection, the approval of the Chief of Police, or
his/her designee and the President of the F.O.P. or his/her designee is
required, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The specific
procedures for drawing on the Pool Time require either prior written
approval or oral verbal approval with subsequent written confirmation
signed by the authorizing supervisor. Such approval must be in writing or
verbal with subsequent written confirmation signed by the authorizing
officer. No time may be charged if the ability of available police personnel
to provide required services would be adversely affected. There shall be
no carryover or borrowing of F.O.P. Pool Time hours among calendar
years. In addition to the Pool Time listed above, the City agrees to provide
an additional 2080 hours for the exclusive use of the duly elected F.O.P.
President who, in place of his or her regular duties, shall be permitted to
conduct F.O.P. business during his or her regular work hours.

(ii) The City agrees to compensate F.O,P. representatives for regularly
scheduled working time missed while attending meetings initiated by and
subject to the control of the IMPD, including F.O.P.-Management
Committee meetings, and while attending joint meetings concerning
renewal of this Agreement. If F.O.P. representatives are required by the

IMPD to attend said meetings on non-scheduled work hours they shall be
compensated, at their regular rate of pay.

E, Special Duty Representative.

An IMPD representative from the elected F.O.P. Executive Board, who is an active duty
IMPD officer and who is selected by the F.O.P. Board, shall be assigned to a Special Duty
assignment to be permitted to serve as a liaison officer between management and labor in an
effort to resolve disputes in a fair and equitable manner and conduct F.O.P. business. Except
when performing tasks specifically assigned to him by the Chief or the Chief s designee, which
tasks shall not be assigned unreasonably to defeat the purpose of the Special Duty assignment,
the F.O.P. representative shall be compensated by drawing against the F.O.P. Pool Time set forth
in subparagraph D above. While the Special Duty assignment is primarily a day shift assignment,
some scheduling flexibility will be allowed in order for the F.O.P. representative to perform
labor-management liaison duties during non-day shift hours. The F.O.P. representative will be

required to document 160 hours of work pursuant to IMPD policies for each pay period. In no
event shall the F.O.P. representative be entitled to overtime compensation under this Agreement
or the Fair Labor Standards Act for time charged by the F.O.P. representative against F.O.P. Pool
Time.

FE, F.O.P. District Representative.

An F.O.P. District Representative will be appointed by the F.O.P. from the middle shift
or late tact shift of each district. Upon the approval of the Deputy Chief or his/her designee,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, these District Representatives will be
allowed to mark out of service if the monthly F.O.P. regular business meeting is held on a
scheduled work day for those representatives, to allow him/her to attend the business meeting
and keep the officers on middle and tact shifts informed of matters of mutual concern and benefit
to the City and the F.O.P.

G. Non-Discrimination.

The IMPD shall not make any regulation affecting the right of any employee to join, or
refrain from joining, the F.O.P.; provided that the City shall retain the full right to control the
employer's property and equipment. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable
Departmental rules, police officers individually and through their F.O.P. representatives shall
have the right to engage in lawful concerted activities for the purpose of meeting and conferring
with the City and to express or communicate any views, grievances, complaints, or opinions
related to the conditions or compensation of public employment or their betterment, free from
restraint, interference, discrimination or reprisal.

Section 3. City Rights.

Non-Discrimination

Section 1. General Application.

The provisions of this Agreement shall be applied equally to all employees without
discrimination as to age, sex, race, color, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity, handicap as

or physical requirements constitute a bona fide occupational qualification, necessary to proper
and efficient administration or as provided by law. The F.O.P. shall share equally with the City
the responsibility for applying this provision of the Agreement. All references to employees in
this Agreement designate both sexes, and wherever the male gender is used, it shall be construed

transfer, layoff, discipline, or discharge of employees, because of age, sex, race, color, creed,
sexual orientation, gender identity, handicap as defined by law, national origin, or religious or
political affiliation, union membership or holding any official union position, or age, except
where specific age, sex or physical requirement constitutes a bona fide occupational qualification

necessary to proper and efficient administration or as provided by law.
Donated Time

All sworn members of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department may participate in the
Donated Time program.

โLeave Time" is defined as vacation time, bonus days, accumulated time off, and perfect
attendance days.

"Immediate Family" is defined as, husband, wife, mother, father, brother, sister, children, step-
children, or any relative or person living in the employee's household for whom the employee
has custodial responsibility or where such person is financially dependent on the employee and
where the presence of the employee is needed.

"Catastrophic injury or illness" is defined as a life threatening condition or combination of
conditions affecting the mental or physical health of an immediate family member. The
catastrophic illness or injury must require the services of a physician.

This program applies to officers who have exhausted all of their leave time and needs to care for
a member of their immediate family who has suffered or is recovering from a catastrophic injury
or illness.

Officers must submit a request for donated time through their chain of command and to the FOP
stating the reasons for their request, the amount of time requested, and provide the required
medical certification, all other necessary and/or requested paperwork and any requested
historical information.

A 3-member board (the "Board") will be established. The Board will set guidelines, and
determine who is eligible to receive time from the donated time bank. The board will consist of
the President of the FOP Lodge #86 or his/her designee, the person who is currently number one
on the current sergeant promotional list, and the Chief of Police or his/her designee. The board
will meet within 5 days of receiving a request for donated time. The decision of the board will
be considered final and is not subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Contract.

The Donated Time Bank will be tracked by the Board, which will be reported by the Board for
information and reconciliation purposes to the Department of Public Safety and Human
Resources. The time bank will never expire and all left over time will roll into the next year.

Officers wishing to donate time to the time bank shall do so in full day increments of vacation
time and accumulated time off. Bonus days and perfect attendance days may also be donated to
the bank. An officer who is granted by the Board the privilege of receiving donated time can
receive such time in one (1) hour increments or full day increments.

Officers wishing to donate time will submit the required form through their chain of command,
similar to the process currently used to request time off. There is no limit to the amount of time

1713546 1
an officer can donate to the bank. All time donated to the bank must be on or before July 1โ of
each calendar year.

Once an officer donates time to the bank, it is permanent and cannot be withdrawn.

Only officers who have donated time to the Donated Time Bank will be eligible for
consideration by the Board to receive donated time from the bank. Officers must have donated a
minimum of eight (8) hours of leave time within the thirty-six (36) months prior to their request
105 โtime from the-hank to be eligible to receive time from the Donated Time Bank.

reassigned will be entitled to have written reasons for the reassignment put in their personnel file,
except that if the reassignment is for a confidential reason the Department is not required to state
the reason in the file. If it is determined that the reason for the reassignment is confidential, then
the Department will provide the officer with a written statement of the reason for the
reassignment. "For the good of the Department" will not be an adequate description of the reason

decides to fill the position other than by assigning officers pursuant to Section 8.A above, then
this process will apply. Bidding for these positions shall be based upon training, education,
experience, ability and performance of the employees submitting bids. If these factors are
relatively equal, then seniority shall control.

Notice of a vacancy must be posted as soon as the vacancy occurs and must specify a
bidding deadline of at least ten (10) calendar days from the initial posting. The position must be
awarded, in conformity with the above paragraph, no more than thirty (30) calendar days from

the date of the posted deadline for the submission of bids.

successfully bid within ten (10) calendar days of its effective date, then the position shall be
considered vacant and shall be filled by another employee from the same bid.

Section 9. Shift Bidding.

The parties agree that the Procedural Bulletin governing shift bidding in place on the
effective date of this Agreement shall remain in force and in effect for the duration of this

prior to that five-year period will not be considered by the Chief when imposing discipline or
recommending discipline to the Merit Board, unless such prior discipline was based upon acts of
a criminal nature.

Section 12. | Communicable Diseases.

The City will form a committee consisting of representatives from Public Safety, the
F.O.P., the medical community and the public health sector. This committee will research and
develop a policy for testing of officers who are exposed to and/or develop communicable

diseases in the line of duty.
Section 13. | Work Schedule.

For the term of this contract the City will maintain the current work schedule of six (6)
consecutive days on duty followed by three (3) consecutive days off for merit officers through
and including the rank of lieutenant in the Operations Division on the day shift, middle shift, late
tactical shift and late shift. Officers assigned to COPS, horse patrol and traffic are specifically
excluded from the provisions of this paragraph.

This work schedule provision is not applicable to officers until twelve (12) months after
they get their first full-duty assignment. During this period, officers shall be assigned work
schedules at the sole discretion of the City.

Section 14. _ Discipline.

A recommendation for discipline shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after the
time the Department learns of the occurrence giving rise to the discipline, unless there is an
investigation by the Office of Internal Affairs or a criminal investigation regarding the incident
giving rise to the discipline. In those instances the Department shall impose the discipline not
later than thirty (30) days after the completion of the investigation. These deadlines will be
extended if either party has a reasonable need for an extension. In the event discipline is not so
imposed, no disciplinary action shall be taken as a result of the incident in question. The
Department will make a good faith effort to complete any internal investigation in a timely
manner.

ARTICLE V
Contract Grievance Procedure
In the event either party believes the other party has breached this Agreement, it shall be

processed through this contract grievance procedure. However, for any disciplinary matters or
other matters covered by merit board proceedings, the officer shall pursue the grievance process
set forth in the General Orders or merit board proceedings only and a grievance may not be filed
under this Agreement. Also, an impasse in any negotiations for any new agreement shall not
constitute a grievance.

The parties shall make sincere and determined efforts to settle meritorious grievances and
to keep the procedure free from unmeritorious grievances. Any resolution of a grievance under
this procedure shall be without precedent or prejudice to either party as to any future matters.

An officer shall have the right to have an F.O.P. representative present during each step
of the grievance procedure. Any response by the City at the various Steps shall be sent to the
F.O.P. and the officer involved.

STEP 1: The matter shall first be taken up between the officer involved and the
supervisor involved.

STEP 2: If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, it must be submitted in writing to the
officer's Deputy Chief within ten (10) calendar days after the occurrence giving rise to the
grievance or it shall be considered as dropped. The grievance must contain at a minimum the
contract provision(s) that allegedly were breached, the date on which the breach allegedly
occurred, and the facts that support the alleged breach. The Deputy Chief or his/her designee
shall reply in writing in ten (10) calendar days or, if not, the grievance shall be deemed denied.

STEP 3: If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the F.0.P. may appeal the matter by
submitting the matter within ten (10) days to the Grievance Board or the grievance shall be
deemed dropped. The Grievance Board shall be composed of two (2) members chosen by the
F.0.P. President and two (2) members chosen by the Chief. The respective members of the joint

board shall be appointed effective January | of each year and shall serve for one (l) year. The

1S
Grievance Board shall meet promptly upon call but in any event, not later than thirty (30) days
after the grievance has been referred to it. A majority vote of the Grievance Board on a grievance
shall be final and binding on the parties. In cases in which the Grievance Board deadlocks, each
side shall submit a written summary of the reasons for its vote to the Chief who shall cast the
deciding vote.

STEP 4: If the grievance is not settled under Step 3, the F.O.P. may appeal the matter by
submitting the grievance within ten (10) calendar days of the decision in Step 3 to the Director of
Public Safety or the grievance shall be deemed dropped. If the grievance is properly appealed to
Step 4, then the matter will be considered by a representative of the F.O.P. and the Director of
Public Safety or his/her designee. The Director of Public Safetyโs decision shall be made in
writing within ten (10) calendar days after submission to him. If the Director of Public Safety is
unable to make a determination within the allotted time, he may seek an extension from the

of Public Safety shall be final and binding upon all parties.

rate shall be calculated by dividing 2080 hours into the sum of the officer's base salary,
educational pay, longevity pay, FTO pay, motorcycle pay, and additional technical pays. Not
included in this rate are shift differential.

ge. Non-F.L.S.A. overtime, also known as gap time overtime, shall be defined as all
hours worked beyond the regularly scheduled work week or work day up to 171 work hours in a
28 day pay period. Hours worked include all time the officer is required to be on duty. Thus, all
hours within the regularly scheduled shift (including mealtime not exceeding 30 minutes) are
considered hours worked. Also considered hours worked are approved overtime; actual court
time; travel time of one hour only when the officer's shift does not begin or end within one hour
of the overtime or court time; mandatory training time in Marion County; mandatory training
time outside Marion County which occurs during the officer's regularly scheduled hours on both
working and non-working days; time spent at the firing range if required by the Department; and
time spent in branch meetings, coroner inquests, merit board hearings, review board hearings,
internal affairs investigations, and required Departmental medical examinations. Travel time or
call back time will not be paid for onsite events, i.e., off duty traffic stops or other incidents for
which the officer is present at the scene and which require police action.

Hours not considered hours worked include, but are not necessarily limited to: on call

time if the officer possesses a beeper or other communication device; unpaid suspension time;
and personal time relating to attendance at commendation ceremonies and participation as a
candidate in promotional and other selection processes.

D. F.L.S.A. overtime is paid at one and one-half times a premium rate which
includes officer's base salary, educational pay, longevity pay, FTO pay, motorcycle pay, shift
differential, and master patrolman/master detective pay. F.L.S.A. overtime is defined as actual
time worked in excess of 171 hours in the 28 day work period.

E. Officers may elect to receive compensation for non-F.L.S.A. or F.L.S.A. overtime
in either cash or time back, subject to the F.L.S.A. limits on accumulation of compensatory time.
The Department shall make this option available in every overtime situation and shall not force,
coerce or intimidate employees into electing comp-time in lieu of cash. However the Department
reserves the option to pay the officer at the end of the year for accumulated overtime above 40
hours. Accumulated overtime on the books may be taken by the officer at any time during his/her
career, with approval of the branch commander and upon completion of the appropriate form.

F. The Department shall make every effort to pay overtime within 30 calendar days
of the date earned, provided required verification slips are tendered in a timely fashion pursuant
to Departmental policies and guidelines. It is understood that some adjustments to overtime so
paid may be necessary at the end of each 28 day work period to compensate for premium time
required for F.L.S.A. overtime.

G. Officers shall receive a minimum of two hours compensation at straight time for
court sessions attended during non-working hours. However, if an officer is late for a court
appearance, he shall not be eligible for this minimum but shall be compensated only for actual

time in court and travel time (if applicable).
(i) The minimum two hour court time shall not be considered hours
worked for calculations relating to F.L.S.A. overtime
compensation.

(ii) Computations shall be made to determine whether an officer would
receive higher compensation under: 1) the minimum two hour
court time at straight time or 2) travel time and actual time in court
at time and one-half. The officer shall be paid at the higher
amount.

H. The Chief of Police, with the approval of the Director of Public Safety, shall
determine the necessity and guidelines for overtime, however, the Department shall not alter
working schedules for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime without making a good
faith effort to give the affected officer at least five (5) working days notice except in the case of
emergency, a national disaster, required dignitary security or other condition beyond the
Department's control of which the Department has not received at least five (5) working days
advance notice. This subsection (H) shall not apply to officers until twelve (12) months after they
get their first full-duty assignment. The Department will make a good faith effort to notify these
officers twenty-four (24) hours in advance of an alteration of their work schedule except in the
case of an emergency, a national disaster, required dignitary security or other condition beyond
the Department's control.

r With respect to the FLSA provisions and the 2007 change to the General Order
governing compensatory time caps, the F.O.P. will indemnify the City and hold it harmless from
any and all claims or liabilities which may arise relating to compensatory time on the books that
exceeds the revised caps.

B. City's Contribution for all Active Police Officers' Health Insurance Coverage
Effective as of January 1, 2014, Through January 1, 2016.

(i) For 2014 through 2016, except as provided by sub-section C below, the
following provisions shall apply for all IMPD officers:

() For officers participating in the Wellness Program and selecting
single or family coverage of the lowest cost HMO plan, the City
agrees to contribute 85% of the premium. Any remaining premium
amounts due shall be solely the obligation of the officer.
Notwithstanding the above, in no event will the officer's
contribution be less than $1.00 per month.

(2) For officers participating in the Wellness Program and selecting
single or family coverage of the more expensive HMO plan, the
City agrees to contribute 85% of the average of the two HMO plan
premiums. Any remaining premium amounts due shall be solely
the obligation of the officer. Notwithstanding the above, in no
event will the officer's contribution be less than $1.00 per month.

(3) For those officers who decline to participate in the Wellness
program, the amount contributed by the City under subsections 1
and 2 above shall be reduced by ten dollars per payroll period in
which insurance deductions are made. To receive the ten dollar
premium discount, the officer must attend a reasonable number of

educational or informational sessions recommended by the Cityโs
wellness consultant.

Cc. Changes in Insurance Structure.

In the event the City changes its current active health insurance structure and instead
offers only one plan comparable to the current HMOs in conjunction with an HSA or HRA
option, then for all officers participating in the Wellness Program and selecting single or family
coverage in that HMO comparable plan, the City agrees to contribute 85% of the cost of the
single or family coverage plan. Any remaining premium amounts due shall be solely the
obligation of the officer. Notwithstanding the above, in no event will the officer's contribution be

less than $1.00 per month. In the event the City does change its insurance structure, the City

24
agrees the FOP will be advised and consulted during the process, but the final right regarding the

Year [ Officer City
2013 $25.00 $50.00
2014 $25.00 $50.00
2015 $25.00 $50.00
2016 [325.00 $50.00

 

In the event the R.H.LF Committee elects to have officers contribute amounts less than
the maximum set forth above, the City's contribution shall also be reduced so that the City's
portion of the premium shall be maintained as a 2 for 1 match,

For active officers who participate in City-sponsored health insurance, the contribution to
the R.H.LF, shall be realized through a reduction in the amount contributed to the cost of such
officersโ insurance by the City as set out in Article VII, Section 2, above. Active officers who do
not participate in City-sponsored health insurance shall be given the opportunity to contribute to
the R.H.LF. through payroll deduction at the rate set forth above. Any active officer who at any
time during his/her period of active service as an officer elects not to contribute to the R.H.LF.
shall not be eligible for a contribution to the cost of his/her health insurance at any time after

retirement.

25
The FOP and the Chief of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department will establish
a R.H.I.F. committee that will determine the amount of retiree health insurance benefits offered
to retirees. R.H.LF. contribution will be announced no later than the last day of November for
benefits to be paid the following calendar year. If the committee commitment exceeds the total
contribution, the active members' contribution will be increased to ensure the fund does not run
short. The City shall have no liability in any shortfall.

At no time will more than 60% of a retiree's monthly health insurance premium be paid
for by the proceeds of this fund.

The R.H.LF. Committee shall be responsible for the best use of the funds. The
Committee will be comprised of an equal number of employees and management not to exceed
three (3) each. In the event of a committee deadlock, it shall be resolved by the Controller of the
City, the Chief of the IMPD and the President of the FOP Lodge 86. Commencing in July 2007
and each year of the contract thereafter the City shall forward all unspent contributions (from
both officers and the City) to an insurance trust established by the F.O.P. The mission of the
insurance trust is to assist retired members of the Department with their health insurance needs.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

The parties understand that the City of Indianapolis (the โCityโ) and the Fraternal Order
of Police, Lodge #86 (the โFOPโ), have negotiated a collective bargaining agreement effective
January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2016 (the โFOP contractโ). The parties further
understand that the City will be commencing negotiations with the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Professional Firefighters Local 416 (the โFirefightersโ) to negotiate the terms of the collective
bargaining agreement between the City and the Firefighters (the โFire Contractโ). This
Memorandum of Understanding is intended to provide for parity with respect to the Firefighters
and the FOP in regard to the following specific contractual provisions identified below:

Section | โ Base Salary. If the negotiations between the City and the Firefighters result
in a base salary percentage increase in Article VII, Section 1 (Base Salary Increase) of the Fire
Contract in years 2014, 2015, or 2016 that exceed the base salary percentage increases provided
to members of the FOP bargaining unit for the same years in Article VI, Section 1 (Base Salary
Increase) of the FOP contract, then Article VI, Section 1 (Base Salary Increase) of the FOP
contract will be modified to provide the same base salary percentage increases in years 2014,
2015, and 2016 to all members of the FOP bargaining unit.

Section 2 โ Longevity Pay. If the Firefighters negotiate an increase in Article VII,
Section 4 (Longevity Pay) and Exhibit D of the Fire Contract that exceeds the longevity pay
benefit provided in Article VII, Section 4 (Longevity Pay) and Exhibit A of the FOP contract,
then Article VII, Section 4 (Longevity Pay) and Exhibit A of the FOP contract will be modified
to provide the same longevity benefit to all members of the FOP bargaining unit.

Section 3 โ Deferred Compensation. If the Firefighters negotiate an increase in the Cityโs
contribution to their deferred compensation benefit in Article VIII, Section 8 (Deferred
Compensation) of the Fire Contract that exceeds the Cityโs contribution to the FOPโs deferred
compensation benefit provided in Article VI, Section 11 (Deferred Compensation) of the FOP
contract, then Article VI, Section 11 (Deferred Compensation) of the FOP contract will be
modified to provide the same City contribution to the deferred compensation benefit to all
members of the FOP bargaining unit.

Section 4 โ Health Insurance for Active Police Officers. If the Firefighters negotiate an
increase in the Cityโs contribution to active Firefightersโ health insurance premiums and plan
design set forth in Article VIII, Section 1(b)(1) & (2) of the Fire Contract that is greater than the
Cityโs contribution to active police officersโ health insurance premiums and plan design as
provided in Article VII, Section 2(B) of the FOP contract, then Article VII, Section 2(B) of the
FOP contract will be modified to provide the same City contribution to the health insurance
premium and plan design of all active police officers covered by the Cityโs health insurance plan.

The parties understand and agree that this Memorandum of Understanding and the parity
provided herein applies only to the specific articles, sections and paragraphs of the respective
Fire contract and FOP contract and does not apply to any other wage or wage-related fringe
benefit in either contract. The parties also agree that this Memorandum of Understanding shall
only apply and be binding upon the City and the FOP during the term of the 2014 โ 2016 FOP
contract. The parties also agree that this Memorandum of Understanding is not intended to
establish a precedent and/or past practice for how parity is handled after the expiration of the
2014 โ 2016 FOP contract.

Memorandum of Understanding

This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into as part of the collective bargaining
agreement between the City of Indianapolis (the โCityโ) and the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge
#86 (the โFOPโ).

Reasons for the Memorandum

 

A. The former Indianapolis Police Department and the law enforcement division of
the Marion County Sheriff's Department (the โMCSDโ) merged to form the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department (the โIMPDโ).

B: Active officers from the MCSD joined the IMPD on June 1, 2007, and those
active MCSD officers became subject to the RHIF program for IMPD. Since the merger, active
MCSD officers who elect to participate in retiree health insurance make their contributions to the
IMPD RHIF.

C. Deputies who retired from the MCSD as of June 1, 2007 and were receiving
retiree health insurance benefits as a consequence of their participation in the MCSDโs retiree
health insurance program are no longer the beneficiaries of payments to the MCSD RHIF by
active IMPD officers formerly with the MCSD.

Dz. Therefore, the parties agree to the following funding arrangement for retiree
health insurance for MCSD deputies who were participating in the MCSD retiree health
insurance program and retired as of June 1, 2007.

The City of Indianapolis (the โCityโ) and the Fraternal Order of Police (the โFOPโ) agree
as follows:

1. The City agrees to make a monthly payment of Four Thousand Dollars
($4,000.00) per month beginning in 2011 to fund the employee portion of the MCSD RHIF. In
no event shall the City be required to increase this portion of the contribution to the RHIF.

2. The parties agree that the following procedure will be followed to cover the
period January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2016. Fora Deputy who retired from the Marion
County Sheriff's Department after at least 20 total years of employment as a Deputy with a
vested right to a pension from the Marion County Sheriff's Pension Trust, even if the pension
payment is not currently payable, the Sheriff shall pay no less that 60% (unless the cap has been
reached) and no more than 75% of the premium for the City-Countyโs group health coverage,
with that amount not to exceed the cap of $537,400.00, as adjusted in paragraph 4 of this
Memorandum, in the year 2011. The $537,400.00 amount will be increased in accordance with
the percentages in the contract for IMPD officersโ salaries of 1% in 2012, 3% in 2013 and 3% in
2014.

When the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare, the Sheriff shall pay 75% of the
premium for a County Medicare Supplement or โMedigapโ policy that โwraps aroundโ and
supplements the retireeโs Medicare coverage (hereinafter referred to as the โMedigap policyโ).
Coverage shall continue under the Medigap policy until the death of the retiree. Upon the
retireeโs death, his/her surviving spouse (if applicable) will be permitted to continue coverage
under the Medigap policy provided the surviving spouse pays 100% of the premium for such
policy.

3 A retiree who does not at the time of retirement take the continued group health
insurance coverage provided for retirees (as stated above) may preserve the right to take the
retiree coverage by maintaining coverage under a group health insurance policy approved by a
state department of insurance and paying a maintenance fee of $40.00 per month. A retiree
covered under the City-County group health plan provided by the retireeโs employment by the
City or County agency, or by the employment of the retireeโs spouse by an agency of City or
County government shall be entitled to maintain eligibility for retiree coverage without payment
of the maintenance fee while covered by a City-County group health plan.

4. Any other amount that the City is required to pay as the employer contribution of
the RHIF contribution pursuant to this Memorandum shall also be reduced on an annual basis to
reflect any reduction in the number of participating retirees. These reductions shall be made by
first calculating any increase to the employer portion of the contribution, referred to in paragraph
2 of this Memorandum, and then by adding the amount referred to in paragraph | of this
Memorandum. That amount shall then be reduced per capita by the percentage reduction in the
number of retirees that occurs during the year, if any. Thus, for 2010, the employer contribution
is $537,400.00. In 2011, the amount of $537,400.00 will be reduced based upon any reduction in
the number of beneficiaries during the year (if any). In no event shall the City be required to
increase its contribution to the RHIF pursuant to this paragraph other than by the requirements
set forth in paragraph 2 of this Memorandum. Further, the parties agree that in no event shall the
City be required to contribute more than 75% of the cost of the premium. Should there be an
excess of funds in this account as a result of the 75% limitation, that excess shall revert to the
City.

3; This Memorandum of Understanding shall remain in effect from January 1, 2014,
through December 31, 2016.
