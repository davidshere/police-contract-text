WHEREAS, the CEA and the City desire to cooperate in establishing conditions which will

WHEREAS, as a result of collective bargaining the parties have reached an Agreement which

Section | of this Article.

2003-2012 CEA -1-
ARTICLE II - UNION SECURITY DUES CHECKOFF

Section 1.

All employees covered by this Agreement shall be free to become and remain members of the CEA in
good standing.

Section 2.

The CEA shall have the exclusive right to the check-off and transmittal of dues in behalf of each
employee in the unit in accord with the Mayor’s Executive Order No. 98, dated May 15, 1969, entitled
“Regulations Regulating the Checkoff of Union Dues” and in accord with the Mayor’s Executive Order
No. 107, dated December 29, 1986, entitled “Regulations Governing Procedures for Orderly Payroll
Checkoff of Union Dues” and any executive orders which amend or supersede said Executive Orders.

proper form, in accord with Section 2 of this Article II, which bears the signature of the employee.

Section 4.

The parties agree to an agency shop to the extent permitted by applicable law, as described in a
supplemental agreement hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

ARTICLE III - HOURS AND OVERTIME

Overtime performed by Captains shall be compensated for in compensatory time off at the rate of time
and one-half when such overtime is ordered by the Police Commissioner or Chief of Department or is

being forwarded through channels together with recommendations, are approved by the Chief of
Department or the Chief of Department’s designee for such purposes.

2003-2012 CEA 2
Section 2. - Quarterly Compensatory Days

Captains shall be compensated for time worked, other than ordered or emergency overtime provided for in
Section | of this Article, prior to or after a regularly scheduled tour of duty up to a maximum of one
compensatory day per quarter if they have accrued eight hours of time for such work performed beyond
their regularly scheduled tours of duty in each such quarter. Such time not utilized in the quarter earned
will be carried over to the next quarter for utilization in that next quarter. Such time will not accrue for
pre-tour time which is less than one (1) hour and post-tour time which is less than thirty (30) minutes or
for time beyond a maximum of four (4) hours surrounding a scheduled tour of duty. The Captain will
maintain a record of such time in an appropriate form. A record will continue to be maintained in the
Command Log Sign In/Out Record or other permanent command record. When such uniformed
employee has accrued eight hours of such time in a quarter, the employee may select and take such
compensatory day off by submitting in advance a Leave of Absence Report with the record of such time
worked to the appropriate commanding officer. This provision does not supersede the lost time procedure
in Administrative Guide Procedure 320-29 which procedure shall continue in full force and effect.

compensation. If bargaining unit members are performing additional training on a range day, they will

without compensation.

Since the basic forty-hour week has not been changed by this Agreement, any modification of standard
charts and use of other tours shall not affect current standard practice for the computation of
compensation for holidays, vacation days, personal leave days, annuity fund contributions and other
relevant benefits, which shall remain on the basis of an eight-hour work day calculation.

The informal resolution of differences of grievances is urged and encouraged at all levels of

employee so chooses), or through the Union, provided however that the Union shall have the
right to have a representative present at each step of the grievance procedure.

2003-2012 CEA 22
Section 4.

Under the grievance procedure herein, a grievance must be initiated within 90 days following the
date on which the grievance arose or the date on which the grievant should reasonably have learned
of the grievance or the execution date of this Agreement, which ever date is the latest. Grievances
shall be processed according to the following procedure:

STEP I.

A grievant shall present the grievance to the Commanding Officer either orally or in writing. The
Commanding Officer shall carefully consider the matter, make a decision thereon and advise the
grievant of the decision within five (5) days of the grievance’s submission.

STEP II.

If the grievance is still not satisfactorily adjusted, at STEP I, the grievant may seek the following
review within ten days after receipt of the Step I decision. The grievant shall reduce the grievance to
writing on Form P.D. 158-151 (in triplicate), setting forth a concise statement of the grievance and

copy to the Commanding Officer, requesting the Commanding Officer’ s comments. The Reviewing
Officer shall carefully consider said grievance, make a determination, and notify the grievant and the

Commanding Officer and the Reviewing Officer, in writing, of its decision within seven days after
the meeting at which the grievance is considered.

2003-2012 CEA. 23
It is understood and agreed by and between the parties that there are certain grievable disputes which
are of a Department level or of such scope as to make adjustments at Step [ or Step II of the
grievance procedure impracticable, and, therefore, such grievances may be instituted at Step III of the
grievance procedure by filing the required written statement of the grievance directly with the
Chairman of the Personnel Grievance Board; the Chairman or Chairman’s designee shall convene a
meeting of the Board within five (5) working days following receipt of the grievance, and the Board
shall render its decision within five (5) working days following that meeting.

calendar days after notification of the Board’s decision, request that the grievance be referred to the
Police Commissioner for determination; and the Police Commissioner shall make a determination
within ten working days following receipt of the grievance. This determination shall be made after
appropriate consultation with any or all parties to the grievance, including the Chairman of the Board
and/or the Board members; and copies shall be sent to the grievant and the Union.

Grievances which affect substantial numbers of employees may be compressed by elimination of the
fourth Step of the Grievance Procedure.

for a satisfactory adjustment. At any step, the Commanding Officer, the Reviewing Officer and the
Board shall have the right to summon the grievant and any and all persons considered necessary to

Dear President Richter:

The City and the Captains Endowment Association (“CEA”) acknowledge that
an Administrative Law Judge of the New York State Public Employment Relations
Board in Case No. DR-119 (dated May 3, 2007) held that the subject of duty charts, as
outlined in 1(d) of Chapter 143 of the Unconsolidated Laws, is a prohibited subject of
bargaining. The City and PBA are appealing that determination and other unions have
been granted permission by PERB to file amicus briefs.

The parties agree to continue in status quo pending a final and binding decision
on that issue by PERB or a court of competent jurisdiction, and all appeals thereto, on
the legal challenges to that decision. In the event the determination in DR-119 that duty
charts are a prohibited subject of bargaining is affirmed, the parties will jointly support
legislation to ameliorate the effect of the decision.

If another uniformed collective bargaining unit has an adjustment made to
their salary schedule through the collective bargaining or arbitration process or
otherwise during the time period covering November 1, 2003 through March 31,
