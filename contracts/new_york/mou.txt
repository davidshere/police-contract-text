Section 8. “Mutual Exchange of Tours”

The ‘Mutual Exchange of Tours’ procedures currently found in paragraph 9. of the Administrative

Section 9. Home Confinement Elimination Pilot Program

Effective the first day of the month following ratification of this Agreement a pilot program
concerning Patrol Guide Procedures 205-01 and 205-45 will be established.

This pilot program will be implemented subject to the following terms:

a. The pilot program will provide that eligible employees, who request sick leave for an injury
or illness, shall no longer be subject to home visitation and confinement, outside the hours
of the employee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty, except where the convalescence for the
injury or illness requires home confinement in the opinion of the Department’s Medical
Division, after consultation with the employee’s personal physician.

b. The following employees are not eligible to participate in the program:
1) Any Employee who is designated as ‘chronic sick’,
2) Any Employee who is on modified assignment,
3) Any Employee who is on dismissal probation,
4) Any Employee who is on suspension.

CG The initial phase of the pilot program will run for a period of 15 months. Provided
however, that in the event the initial phase of the pilot program is deemed to be successful,
whereby the annualized average sick leave usage for the entire PBA bargaining unit in the
15 month period is less than the designated absence rate plus 10%, the pilot program will
automatically be extended until the end of the this contract term. If the second phase of the
pilot program is successful, whereby the annualized average sick leave usage for the entire
PBA bargaining unit in the second phase of the pilot program is less than the designated
absence rate, plus 10 % the parties will meet to discuss implementing the pilot program on a
permanent basis.

including both line of duty and non-line of duty sick leave, per member of service in the
PBA bargaining unit for Fiscal Year 2007-2008, which equals 11.56 days per year.

2) The Department, on the first day of each month, will review police officer availability
for the preceding 365 days. In the event that police officer average sick leave for the
entire PBA bargaining unit exceeds the designated absence rate for the preceding 365
day period by more than 10%, the previous Patrol Guide home visitation and
confinement policies will be placed into effect the following day. Such procedures will
remain in effect for the remainder of the month. Provided however, the Police
Commissioner in his own discretion may permit the new procedures to remain in effect.

3) The following month another review of sick leave usage for the preceding 365 days will
occur. When a monthly review results in a return to a level at or below the “designated
absence rate” plus 10% the Department will resume the new visitation and confinement
procedures the following day (the second day of the month).
