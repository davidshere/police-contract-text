Harry Nespoli

Chair, Municipal Labor Committee
125 Barclay Street

New York, NY 10007

Dear Mr. Nespoli:
This is to confirm the parties’ mutual understanding concerning the following issues:

U6 Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Welfare Fund contribution will remain
constant for the length of the successor unit agreements, including the $65 funded from the
Stabilization Fund pursuant to the 2005 Health Benefits Agreement between the City of New
York and the Municipal Labor Committee.

2. Effective July 1, 2014, the Stabilization Fund shall convey $1 Billion to the City of New
York to be used to support wage increases and other economic items for the current round of
collective bargaining (for the period up to and including fiscal year 2018). Up to an additional
total amount of $150 million will be available over the four year period from the Stabilization
Fund for the welfare funds, the allocation of which shall be determined by the parties. Thereafter,
$ 60 million per year will be available from the Stabilization Fund for the welfare funds, the
allocation of which shall be determined by the parties.

3. If the parties decide to engage in a centralized purchase of Prescription Drugs, and
savings and efficiencies are identified therefrom, there shall not be any reduction in welfare fund
contributions.

4. There shalt be a joint committee formed that will engage in a process to select an
independent healthcare actuary, and any other mutually agreed upon additional outside expertise,
te develop an accounting system to measure and calculate savings.
5. The MLC agrees to generate cumulative healthcare savings of $3.4 billion over the
course of Fiscal Years 2015 through 2018, said savings to be exclusive of the monies referenced
in Paragraph 2 above and generated in the individual fiscal years as follows: (i) $400 million in
Fiscal Year 2015; (ii) $700 million in Fiscal Year 2016; (iii) $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2017; (iv)
$1.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2018; and (v) for every fiscal year thereafter, the savings on a
citywide basis in health care costs shall continue on a recurring basis. At the conclusion of Fiscal
Year 2018, the parties shall calculate the savings realized during the prior four-year period. In
the event that the MLC has generated more than $3.4 billion in cumulative healthcare savings
during the four-year period, as determined by the jointly selected healthcare actuary, up to the
first $365 million of such additional savings shall be credited proportionately to each union as a
one-time lump sum pensionable bonus payment for its members. Should the union desire to use
these funds for other purposes, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to agree on an
appropriate alternative use. Any additional savings generated for the four-year period beyond the
first $365 million will be shared equally with the City and the MLC for the same purposes and
subject to the same procedure as the first $365 million. Additional savings beyond $1.3 billion in
FY 2018 that carry over into FY 2019 shall be subject to negotiations between the parties.

6. The following initiatives are among those that the MLC and the City could consider in
their joint efforts to meet the aforementioned annual and four-year cumulative savings figures:
minimum premium, self-insurance, dependent eligibility verification audits, the capping of the
HIP HMO rate, the capping of the Senior Care rate, the equalization formula, marketing plans,
Medicare Advantage, and the more effective delivery of health care.

7. Dispute

a. In the event of any dispute under this agreement, the parties shail meet and confer

in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If the parties cannot resolve the dispute, such

dispute shall be referred to Arbitrator Martin F. Scheinman for resolution.

Such dispute shall be resolved within 90 days.

The arbitrator shall have the authority to impose interim relief that is consistent

with the parties’ intent.

d. The arbitrator shall have the authority to meet with the parties at such times as the

arbitrator determines is appropriate to enforce the terms of this agreement.

If the parties are unable to agree on the independent health care actuary described

above, the arbitrator shall select the impartial health care actuary to be retained by

the parties.

f. The parties shall share the costs for the arbitrator and the actuary the arbitrator
selects.

Re: 2016 Agreement between the City of New York and the Municipal Labor
Committee Regarding the One-Time Lump Sum Payment of $100 to the
Welfare Funds

Dear Harry Nespoli:

As memorialized in a February 19, 2016 written letter agreement (attached) between the City of
New York (“City”) and the Municipal Labor Committee (“MLC”), “[t]he City has agreed to
authorize the release of $100 per active employee and retiree to the welfare funds from the [Health
Benefits] Stabilization Fund”. The one-time lump sum payment of $100 will be paid to the welfare
funds as of July 1, 2016, the effective date of the agreed upon changes set forth in the February
19, 2016 letter agreement.

The payment to the welfare funds shall be made on behalf of each full time per annum employee
and retiree or other applicable equivalent for other than full time per annum employees or retirees
eligible for welfare fund contributions on July 1, 2016. For other than full time per annum
employees and retirees, payment shall be in accordance with the applicable welfare fund
agreement.

In order to implement the payment to the welfare funds, as referenced in the February 19, 2016
letter agreement, kindly indicate your agreement to modify your individual Welfare Fund
agreement, in accordance with what was previously agreed to by the City and the MLC, and to
incorporate such amendment into your Welfare Fund agreements by affixing your signature in
the space provided below. Please return the signed letter to Georgette Gestely, Director,
Employee Benefits Program.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Very truly yours,

GLK PZ.

‘Mt. Harry Nespoli

Chair, Municipal Labor Committee
125 Barclay Street

New York, NY 10007

Dear Mr. Nespoli:

Jam extremely pleased that the City and the Municipal Labor Committee have reached another agreement
regarding securing the health savings for Fiscal Year 2016 and 2017. J want to thank you and all of the members
of the Municipal Labor Committee Health Insurance Policy Committee for the exhaustive efforts to get this
finalized. We should all be especially proud of having achieved these unprecedented savings in a collaborative
working relationship, and in the context of providing access to plans that emphasize the healch of our
employees through a focus on access to primary and preventive care.

Arvached is a chart that itemizes the total savings projections for the benefit plan design changes agreed upon.
‘There is also a chart chat demonstrates how the changes get us to the FY 2016 and 2017 health care savings
targets, The savings estimates have been agreed upon by both Milliman, the City’s actuary, and Segal, the
Municipal Labor Committee's actuary.

The rotal of the carryover from FY 2016 savings to FY 2017, along with our other new programs, is expected to
be approximately $851.8 million before the plan design changes. We are projecting the new plan design
changes to result in $149.1 million savings, allowing us to achieve the $1 billion target for Fiscal Year 2017.

For FY 2016, we expect to achieve $653 of the $700 million target if we implement the changes June 1, and there
will have to be 2 $47 million adjustment paid from the Stabilization Fund. Lf the implementation of the plan
design changes is delayed to July 1, 2016, the FY 2016 savings will be reduced to $642 million and will require a
$58 million adjustment from the Stabilization Fund.

As we have done previously, the savings are based on estimates and there will be a true up process after the end
of each fiscal year. When the final savings are determined, they willbe accounted forinthe following wwoways:

Direct Savings: These savings are from healthcare programs and initiatives that result in a lower amount
directly paid by che City through a reduction for employee healthcare costs in the HIP-HMO and the GHI
ceva and the City headcount resulting from the Dependent Eligibility Verification Audit
(DEVA).
Page 2

Savings OF the Equalization Payment: These savings are from healthcare programs and initiatives that donot
accrue directly to the City and will be deemed as an offset to the equalization payment due by the City to the
Stabilization Fund. The equalization payment, due fram the City to the Stabilization Reserve Fund,
represents the difference berween the HIP-HMO rate and the GHI-CBP rate.

The cost estimates are also based on the HIP HMO retaining its status as a grandfathered plan, as supported by
the attached letter from Emblem Healch which indicates that “the contemplated changes should not adversely
affect the CNY HMO Plan's grandfather health plan status.’

Uhave also arrached a letter from the City of New York Law Department indicating that the proposed changes
to the HIP- HMO Preferred Plan comport with the requirements of Administrative Code Section 12-126(b)(1).

As agreed previously, the ongoing cost of the preventive procedures, visits and drugs incurred as the result of
the CBP losing its grandfathered status, will be paid from the Stabilization Fund (estimated at $483 million for
FY 2017).

The City has agreed co authorize the release of $100 per active employee and retiree to the welfare funds from
the Stabilization Fund effective June 1, 2016 (or whenever the proposed changes go into effect), primarily to
provide relief for the escalating costs of prescription drugs. [t was also agreed that the Stabilization Fund
would release an equivalent amount to the City as of that date.

We lock forward to continuing our work on health care savings and the very real potential of being able to
share some of the savings with employees should we exceed the $3.4 billion target.
