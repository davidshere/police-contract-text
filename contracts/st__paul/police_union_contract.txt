ARTICLE 4 — SECURITY

4.2

4.3

4.4

4.5

4.6

The EMPLOYER shall deduct from the wages of employees who authorize such a
deduction, in writing, an amount necessary to cover monthly FEDERATION dues. Such
monies shall be remitted as directed by the FEDERATION.

The FEDERATION may designate employees from the bargaining unit to act as stewards
and shall inform the EMPLOYER in writing of such choice.

The EMPLOYER shall make space available on the employee bulletin board for posting
official FEDERATION notices and announcements.

If upon review, the department head or authorized representative in charge of the facility
or work area where the notice(s) or announcement(s) is to be posted disapproves of the
posted item(s), it shall be removed.

The FEDERATION agrees to indemnify and hold the EMPLOYER harmless against any
and all claims, suits, orders, or judgments brought or issued against the City as a result of
any action taken or not taken by the City under the provisions of this Article.

Release time for negotiations. During each round of negotiations, four individuals (not
including the Federation President) will be allowed to meet with the City’s authorized
representative, without loss of pay, for the purpose of wage, salary, or fringe benefit
discussions. Each individual is eligible for up to 12 hours of such release time.

Federation Release Time Bank. Each member of the Federation shall have his/her
vacation balance reduced by three (3) hours annually for the purpose of establishing a
Federation Release Time Bank of vacation hours to be used by the Federation President
and Members of the Federation Board to conduct union business. The individual elected
Federation President shall be released from a minimum of 50% (1040 hours) of his/her
normal duties, members of the Federation Executive Board may utilize the remaining
ARTICLE 4 - SECURITY (Continued)

hours donated. The donation bank shall be established each year based on the number of
employees covered by the bargaining unit as of the first date of the new payroll year. The
Federation will provide annual written notice to the Department of who is eligible for
Federation Release for the year. Eligible Federation Board members must receive prior
authorization from his/her supervisor. The Federation shall make monthly Release Time
usage reports to the Department. Failure to make a monthly report will result in
forfeiture of the remaining balance of hours in the Federation Release Time Bank. There
shall be no annual carryover of any unused Federation Release Time hours.

In addition, the Federation will pay a $5000.00 administrative fee each year to the
DEPARTMENT.

It is understood that the President’s release time will be taken in whole day increments as
much as possible and that the President will work with his/her supervisor to identify
which days each pay period will be release time days. It is also understood that, during
his/her release time, the Federation President’s activities are up to the Federation’s
discretion. Board Member release time will be taken in whole hour increments. Once
board release time is approved by the member’s supervisor, the Board member’s
activities are up to the Federation’s discretion so long as the release time is used for
legitimate union business.

It is further understood that, as with all employees and consistent with Article 30, the
assignment (including any special assignments) for the individual serving as Federation
President will be determined by the DEPARTMENT HEAD.

ARTICLE 5 - EMPLOYER AUTHORITY

5.1

5.2

The FEDERATION recognizes the prerogatives of the EMPLOYER to operate and
manage its affairs in all respects in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of
appropriate authorities. The prerogatives and authority that the EMPLOYER has not
officially abridged, delegated or modified by this AGREEMENT are retained by the
EMPLOYER.

A public employer is not required to meet and negotiate on matters of inherent
managerial policy which include, but are not limited to such areas of discretion or policy
as the functions and programs of the EMPLOYER, its overall budget, utilization of
technology, and organizational structure and selection, and direction and number of
personnel.

6.3

PROCEDURE
DEFINITION OF GRIEVANCE

A grievance is defined as a dispute or disagreement as to the interpretation or application
of the specific terms and conditions of the AGREEMENT.

It is specifically understood that any matters governed by Civil Service Rules or statutory
provisions shall not be considered grievances and subject to the grievance procedure
hereinafter set forth. Disciplinary actions may be appealed to either the Civil Service
Commission or to an arbitrator. However, reprimands may not be appealed to the Civil
Service Commission. If disciplinary action is grieved under the terms of this contract, the
union’s Step 2 written grievance must state whether the grievance, if still unresolved after
Step 3, will be appealed to the Civil Service Commission or to an arbitrator.

Nothing in this Article precludes employees from pursuing whatever recourse they may
have under the terms of the Veterans Preference Act.

FEDERATION REPRESENTATIVES

The EMPLOYER will recognize REPRESENTATIVES designated by the
FEDERATION as the grievance representatives of the bargaining unit having the duties
and responsibilities established by this Article. The FEDERATION shall notify the
EMPLOYER in writing of the names of such FEDERATION REPRESENTATIVES and
of their successors when so designated.

PROCESSING OF GRIEVANCE

It is recognized and accepted by the FEDERATION and the EMPLOYER that the
processing of grievances as hereinafter provided is limited by the job duties and
responsibilities of the EMPLOYEES and shall therefore be accomplished during normal
working hours only when consistent with such EMPLOYEE duties and responsibilities.

The aggrieved EMPLOYEE and the FEDERATION REPRESENTATIVE shall be
allowed a reasonable amount of time without loss in pay when a grievance is investigated
and presented to the EMPLOYER during normal working hours, provided the
EMPLOYEE and the FEDERATION REPRESENTATIVE have notified and received
the approval of the designated supervisor who has determined that such absence is
reasonable and would not be detrimental to the work programs of the EMPLOYER.
ARTICLE 6 - EMPLOYEE AND FEDERATION RIGHTS - GRIEVANCE

6.4

PROCEDURE (Continued)

PROCEDURES

Grievances, as defined by Section 6.1, shall be resolved in conformance with the
following procedure:

Step 1

Step 2

Step 3

An EMPLOYEE claiming a violation concerning the interpretation or
application of the CONTRACT shall, within twenty-one (21) calendar days
after such alleged violation has occurred, present such grievances to the
EMPLOYEE’S supervisor as designated by the EMPLOYER. The
EMPLOYER designated representative will discuss and give an answer to such
Step 1 grievance within ten (10) calendar days after receipt. A grievance not
resolved in Step 1 and appealed to Step 2 shall be placed in writing setting forth
the nature of this grievance, the facts on which it is based, the provision or
provisions of the CONTRACT allegedly violated, the remedy requested, and
shall be appealed to Step 2 within ten (10) calendar days after the EMPLOYER
designated representative’s final answer in Step 1. Any grievance not appealed
in writing to Step 2 by the FEDERATION within ten (10) calendar days shall be
considered waived.

If appealed, the written grievance shall be presented by the FEDERATION to,
and discussed with, the EMPLOYER designated Step 2 representative. The
EMPLOYER designated representative shall give the FEDERATION the
EMPLOYER’S Step 2 answer in writing within ten (10) calendar days after
receipt of such Step 2 grievance. A grievance not resolved in Step 2 may be
appealed to Step 3 within ten (10) calendar days following the EMPLOYER
designated representative’s final Step 2 answer. Any grievance not appealed in
writing to Step 3 by the FEDERATION within ten (10) calendar days shall be
considered waived.

If appealed, the written grievance shall be presented by the FEDERATION to,
and discussed with the EMPLOYER designated Step 3 representative. The
EMPLOYER designated representative shall give the FEDERATION the
EMPLOYER’S Step 3 answer in writing within ten (10) calendar days after
receipt of such Step 3 grievance. A grievance not resolved in Step 3 may be
appealed by the FEDERATION to Step 4 within ten (10) calendar days
following the EMPLOYER designated representative’s final answer in Step 3.
Any grievance not appealed in writing to Step 4 by the FEDERATION within
ten (10) calendar days shall be considered waived.
ARTICLE 6 - EMPLOYEE AND FEDERATION RIGHTS - GRIEVANCE
PROCEDURE (Continued)

Step 4

Optional Mediation Step

1.

If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved at Step 3,
either the Federation or the Employer may, within ten (10)
calendar days, request mediation. If the parties agree that the
grievance is suitable for mediation, the parties shall submit a joint
request to the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services for the
assignment of a mediator.

Grievance mediation shall be completed within 30 days of the
assignment.

Grievance mediation is an optional and voluntary part of the
grievance resolution process. It is a supplement to, not a substitute
for, grievance arbitration. When grievance mediation is invoked,
the contractual time limit for moving the grievance to arbitration
shall be delayed for the period of mediation.

The grievance mediation process shall be informal. Rules of
evidence shall not apply, and no record shall be made of the
proceeding. Both sides shall be provided ample opportunity to
present the evidence and argument to support their case. The
mediator may meet with the parties in joint session or in separate
caucuses.

At the request of both parties, the mediator may issue an oral
recommendation for settlement. Either party may request that the
mediator assess how an arbitrator might rule in this case.

The grievant shall be present at the grievance mediation
proceeding. If the grievance is resolved, the grievant shall sign a
statement agreeing to accept the outcome. Unless the parties agree
otherwise, the outcome shall not be presidential.

If the grievance is not resolved and is subsequently moved to
arbitration, such proceeding shall be de novo. Nothing said or
done by the parties or the mediator during grievance mediation
with respect to their positions concerning resolution or offers of
settlement may be used or referred to during arbitration.

A grievance unresolved in Step 3 and appealed to Step 4 shall be submitted to
arbitration subject to the provisions of the Public Employment Labor Relations
Act of 1971. The selection of an arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the
“Rules Governing the Arbitration of Grievances” as established by the Board
Bureau of Mediation Services.

PROCEDURE (Continued)

ARBITRATOR’S AUTHORITY

A.

The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or
subtract from the terms and conditions of the AGREEMENT. The arbitrator shall
consider and decide only the specific issue(s) submitted in writing by the
EMPLOYER and the FEDERATION, and shall have no authority to make a
decision on any other issue not so submitted.

The arbitrator shall be without power to make decisions contrary to or inconsistent
with or modifying or varying in any way the application of laws, rules or
regulations having the force and effect of law. The arbitrator’s decision shall be
submitted in writing within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the
submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to an
extension. The decision shall be based solely on the arbitrator’s interpretation or
application of the express terms of this AGREEMENT and to the facts of the
grievance presented.

The fees and expenses for the arbitrator’s services and proceedings shall be borne
equally by the EMPLOYER and the FEDERATION, provided that each party shall
be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. If either
party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it may cause such a record to be
made, providing it pays for the record. If both parties desire a verbatim record of
the proceedings, the cost shall be shared equally.

WAIVER

If a grievance is not presented within the time limits set forth above, it shall be
considered “waived”. If a grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified
time limit, or any agreed extension thereof, it shall be considered settled on the basis of
the EMPLOYER’S last answer. If the EMPLOYER does not answer a grievance or an
appeal thereof within the specified time limits, the FEDERATION may elect to treat the
grievance as denied at that step and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step.
The time limit in each step may be extended by mutual written agreement of the
EMPLOYER and the FEDERATION in each step.

RECORDS

All documents, communications and records dealing with a grievance shall be filed
separately from the personnel files of the involved EMPLOYEE(S).
ARTICLE 7 — SAVINGS CLAUSE

71

This AGREEMENT is subject to the laws of the United States, the State of Minnesota
and the City of Saint Paul. In the event any provisions of this AGREEMENT shall be
held to be contrary to law by a court of competent jurisdiction from whose final judgment
or decree no appeal has been taken within the time provided, such provisions shall be
voided. All other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The voided provision
may be renegotiated at the written request of either party.

Employee’s normal hourly rate in either compensatory time or in cash, subject to the
limitations of Section 8.2, for hours that exceed daily planned scheduling by the
EMPLOYER. The EMPLOYER shall use its best efforts to equitably distribute overtime
work when scheduling events or other work that is not unique or particular to any one
employee.

Employees may accumulate up to a maximum of one hundred (100) hours of compensatory time.

For the classifications of ECC Shift Supervisor, ECC Telecommunicator, Fire Dispatcher — ECC,
and Police Dispatcher — ECC, employees who give five (5) days advance notice of a request for
compensatory time off, within 24 hours of receiving the request the Employer will post the
opportunity to work the time requested off. If the request will not compromise minimum staffing
levels or if another employee volunteers to work during the requested time off, the covered
portion of the time off request will be granted. If the request will compromise minimum staffing
levels and the requested time off is not covered by a volunteer within 48 hours of the start of the
requested time off, the request will be denied. If an employee requests compensatory time off on
less than five (5) days notice, it shall be within the Employer’s discretion to grant or deny the
request.

An EMPLOYEE required to stand-by for court appearance during scheduled off-duty
time will be compensated for a minimum of two (2) hours based on the EMPLOYEE’S

Active Employee Insurance

16.1

16.2

The insurance plans, premiums for coverage, and benefits contained in the insurance

the Employer and the benefit providers. The Employer will attempt to prevent any

selecting the offered plans agree to accept any changes in benefits which a specific
provider implements.

If in either year the number of plans increases, the increase will be based on the average
premium.

insurance plan, will not be required to select mandatory health insurance coverage as long
as one of the spouses is participating in the City’s insurance plan with family coverage.

The mandatory life insurance continues to apply. In this event, two hundred and twenty
five dollars ($225.00 per month) shall be eligible for payment as unused benefit dollars.
Such payment shall be made during the month of January for the previous insurance year.

Under the “Cafeteria Plan,” employees covered by this agreement will be eligible to

retiree shall have the option, within thirty (30) days, to continue the current
hospitalization and medical benefits which said dependents previously had, at the
premium and Employer contribution accorded to the eligible deceased retiree.

In the event of the death of an employee killed in the line of duty, the Employer will

ARTICLE 24 —- SICK LEAVE

24.1 During any period in which an EMPLOYEE is absent from work on sick leave, with or
without pay, he shall not be employed or engage in any occupation for compensation outside

of his/her regular City employment. Violation of the provisions of this paragraph by any
EMPLOYEE shall be grounds for suspension or discharge.

24.2 In the case of a serious illness or disability of a parent or household member, the head of the
department shall grant leave with pay in order for the employee to care for or to make
arrangements for the care of such sick and disabled persons. Such paid leave shall be drawn
from the employee’s accumulated sick leave credits. Use of such sick leave shall be limited
for forty (40) hours per incident.

An employee may use sick leave for absences due to an illness of the employee’s child for such
reasonable periods as the employee’s attendance with the child may be necessary, on the same
terms the employee is able to use sick leave for his/her own illness. An employee may also use
up to forty (40) hours per incident to arrange for the care of a seriously ill or disabled child.

24.3. The head of the department or the Human Resources Director may require a physician’s
certificate or additional certificate at any time during an employee’s use of sick leave for the

purposes stated in 24.2 above. All such certificates shall be forwarded by the appointing
officer to the Office of Human Resources.

If an employee is absent because of the provisions of Article 24.2 for three or fewer calendar days
he/she shall submit to the head of the department a certificate signed by the employee stating the
nature of the child, parent, or household member’s sickness. If the sickness continues for more
than three calendar days, no further sick leave shall be granted unless or until a physician is
consulted. The sick leave may be continued from and including the day of consultation, but only if
a certificate signed by the physician certifying to the nature and period of the person’s sickness is
submitted and approved by the head of the department and forwarded to the Office of Human
Resources.

25

24.6

No sick leave shall be granted for the above reasons unless the employee reports to
his/her department head the necessity for the absence not later than one-half hour after
his/her regularly scheduled time to report for work, unless he/she can show to the
satisfaction of the department head that the failure to report was excusable.

An employee shall be paid under the provisions of this article only for the number of days or
hours for which he/she would normally have been paid if he/she had not been on sick leave.

Effective July 1, 2005, employees in the job classification of Police Trainee, Police

where the last available Annual Report of the City Risk Management Office shall show
average sick leave used per employee in the titles of Police Officer, Sergeant, Lieutenant
and Commander (based on the 1972 Annual Report method of calculating same) of seven
(7) days or less. For any employee hired after January 1, 2006, the maximum paid time
off under this Section 25.2 shall be three (3) months.

25.2(1) The seven (7) day bargaining unit qualification will not include sick leave
usage in excess of four consecutive months. Sick leave days converted under
the vacation conversion program will also be excluded.

EMPLOYEES injured or incapacitated by illness in the line of duty shall be entitled to
reinstatement at any time within five (5) years from the date of injury or incapacity,
provided they are physically capable of resuming their job.

Except as specifically provided in this Article, all illness and incapacity rules and policies
previously in effect shall continue.

26
ARTICLE 26 —- MATERNITY LEAVE

26.1 Maternity is defined as the physical state of pregnancy of an employee, commencing

been previously scheduled to work during the requested leave time.

27.2 (4) The Department reserves the right to request appropriate documentation
relating to the death at issue prior to granting Bereavement Leave. Such
request for documentation shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 6

27
ARTICLE 28 — DISCIPLINE

28.1

The Employer may discipline employees in any of the forms listed below:

Oral reprimand
Written reprimand
Suspension
Demotion
Discharge

The Employer will discipline employees for just cause only and in accordance with the
concept of progressive discipline.

ARTICLE 29 — SENIORITY

29.1

29.2

29.3

Seniority, for the purpose of this AGREEMENT, shall be defined as follows:

The length of continuous, regular and probationary service with the EMPLOYER from
the date an employee was first certified and appointed to a class title covered by this
AGREEMENT, it being further understood that seniority is confined to the current class
assignment held by an employee. In cases where two or more employees are appointed
to the same class title on the same date, the seniority shall be determined by employee’s
rank on the eligible list from which certification was made. Seniority shall terminate
when an employee retires, resigns, or is discharged.

In the event it is determined by the EMPLOYER that it is necessary to reduce the
workforce, employees will be laid off by class title within each department based on
inverse length of class seniority as defined above.

In cases where there are promotional series, when the number of employees in these
higher titles is to be reduced, employees who have held lower titles which are in this
bargaining unit will be offered reductions to the highest of these titles to which class
seniority would keep them from being laid off, before layoffs are made by any class title
within any department.

It is understood that such employees will pick up their former seniority date in any class
of positions that they previously held.

Recall from layoff shall be in inverse order of layoff, except that recall rights shall expire

after two years of layoff. However the recall rights for ranking officers (i.e.; Sergeants
and above) shall expire after three years of layoff.

28
ARTICLE 30 — BIDDING

30.1

30.2

30.3

30.4

30.5

30.6

Once a year the Department shall hold a bid for Patrol Officers working District
assignments. Officers assigned to a District shall be allowed to bid for their work shifts,
i.e.; midnights, days and afternoons and assignments to shifts will be based upon an
Officer’s seniority. The bid card shall also include District preference. The Department
shall attempt to assign Officers to their preferred District area. However, when a District
assignment conflicts with a work shift bid, the work shift bid shall take preference.

The Department retains the right to designate special assignments to District personnel
levels and such special assignments are not governed by the seniority bid system
described above. The Department also reserves the right to make adjustments to the
District personnel assignments. Such reassignment shall, whenever possible, honor the
original seniority shift bids.

Those Patrol Officers assigned to other Units shall also be given bid cards. If an Officer
is transferred from an assignment not covered by this section to a Team assignment, the
Department shall make every effort to honor the Officer’s yearly bid card.

The Employer agrees to form a committee made up of Federation-appointed and
Department-appointed members to meet and confer on procedures, policy, and substance
related to the appointment of special assignment jobs.

All employer/employee committees meeting times shall be considered part of an
employee’s regular work schedule. Any work performed by an employee for the
committee may be done during their normal work hours if it does not create a burden on
the unit to which they are assigned.

EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS CENTER ASSIGNMENTS

Once per year the EMPLOYER shall issue seniority bid cards to *Emergency
Communications Center Telecommunicators, Fire Dispatcher —- Emergency
Communications Center and Police Dispatcher - Emergency Communications Center.
Such EMPLOYEES shall complete the bid card as to preference for shift (Tour I, II, III)
which shall be assigned based on classification seniority.

ARTICLE 31— WORK BREAKS

31.1

31.2

EMPLOYEES in the titles of “Emergency Communications Center Telecommunicator, Fire
Dispatcher — Emergency Communications Center and Police Dispatcher —- Emergency
Communications Center shall be allowed adequate time from work within each four
consecutive hours of work to use the nearest convenient restroom and/or as relief from work.

If said EMPLOYEE is required to work a full one-half shift beyond his/her regular end of
tour, he/she shall be entitled to the rest period that occurs during said one-half shift.

29
ARTICLE 32 — CHANGE IN SHIFT

32.1

32.2

32.3

Dignitary Visits — Should the Employer determine in its sole discretion that schedule
changes are necessary to provide staffing required to adequately accommodate a visit to
St. Paul by an individual for whom a State or Federal government agency has requested
special security precautions, the following schedule change provisions shall apply:

32.1(1) When an employee is required to change their normally scheduled day off
with less than 96 hours notice, the employee shall be entitled to compensation
based on the following schedule:

Minimum Advance Notice Compensation

96 hours 2 hours compensatory time
72 hours 3 hours compensatory time
48 hours 4 hours compensatory time
24 hours 5 hours compensatory time

If the employee receives less than 24 hours advance notice, all hours worked
that depart from the employee’s regular work schedule shall be compensated
at time and one-half the employee’s regular hourly rate.

32.1(2) When an employee is ordered to work on a scheduled off day, s/he shall also
be given an alternate day off to be determined by his/her supervisor. The
alternate day off shall be scheduled sometime within the employee’s 28-day
FLSA work period, or the following 28-day FLSA work period if the change
in work schedule will not trigger FLSA overtime.

For purposes of this Section, a “change in work schedule” means changing a scheduled
off day to a scheduled work day or changing the starting and ending time of an
employee’s shift (but not the total number of consecutive hours of work) on a scheduled
work day by more than 90 minutes. This Article does not apply to changes for which the
only change from the employee’s regularly scheduled shift is an early start or hold-over
that results in the employee working more hours than s/he would normally have worked
during such scheduled shift.

The provisions of this Article do not supersede and shall not be used to circumvent the
provisions of Article 9 (Court Time), Article 10 (Call Back), or other overtime provisions
of the Labor Agreement.

ARTICLE 33 — PARKING

33.1

The City shall provide parking for all employees covered by this Agreement, at or within
a reasonable distance from their work location, at no cost to the employee. In lieu of the
City charging employees directly for parking at their work location, the Union shall pay

to the City a lump sum of $25,600 per year, paid on or before April 1 of each year.

30
ARTICLE 34 — FITNESS FOR DUTY —- PSYCHOLOGICAL

34.1

EXAMINATIONS

Psychological Examinations. No employee shall be referred to any psychiatric or
psychological testing or examination unless the City has reasonable cause, as established
under the circumstances described below. Notice of such referral shall be made in
writing to the employee stating in full the reasons for said referral.

When an employee is referred for a psychological or psychiatric fitness for duty
examination, such examination shall be conducted by one of the professionals selected by
the employee from a panel established by mutual agreement between the City and the
Federation. The panel shall consist of not less than three (3) licensed psychiatrists or
psychologists (the “Medical Professional”) who have expertise regarding psychological
or emotional disorders and who are qualified to opine as to the employee’s fitness to
engage in law enforcement duties. If the employee fails to select a Medical Professional
from the panel and schedule an initial appointment within ten (10) days of the notice of
referral, the City may select the medical Professional from the panel.

The decision of the Medical Professional shall be final and binding on the parties as to
the fitness for duty of the employee. The cost of the examination shall be paid by the
City. The City agrees that it will limit the documentation it obtains from the examination
to the Medical Professional’s medical conclusion as to whether that employee is fit for
duty. The City agrees to maintain the information noted above in strict confidentiality
subject to the requirements of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.

At such time as the City determines that an employee shall be required to submit to a
fitness for duty evaluation and during the time the evaluation is pending, the City shall
reassign the employee to other duties or place the employee on paid administrative leave.
However, such assignment or pay status may be revoked or discipline imposed if the
employee fails to cooperate with the City or the Medical Professional including any
failure to provide documentation or waivers deemed necessary by the Medical
Professional in order to prepare the fitness for duty examination under these provisions.

After an employee who has been found to be not fit for duty has exhausted his/her
incapacitation benefits under Article 25 and any sick leave, vacation, and compensatory
time banks, the City in its sole discretion, shall either assign the employee to a limited
duty assignment or place the employee on an unpaid medical leave of absence. Such
unpaid medical leave of absence shall last not less than two (2) years. FMLA benefits
shall run from the date employee has been determined to be not fit for duty. The
employee shall be entitled to return to his/her last held rank if, prior to the expiration of
the leave of absence, the Medical Professional who originally made the finding that the
employee was not fit for duty determines that the employee has regained his/her ability to
perform the essential functions of the job. If the Medical Professional who originally
made the finding that the employee was not fit for duty is no longer licensed to practice
in the State of Minnesota, such determination of rehabilitation and fitness to return to
work may be made by any Medical Professional currently on the panel. In the event of
reinstatement, the City shall pay for the cost of any training or certification necessary for
the employee to return to active duty as a peace officer.

31
ARTICLE 34 — FITNESS FOR DUTY —- PSYCHOLOGICAL

34.2

34.3

34.4

EXAMINATIONS (Continued)

Circumstances Permitting Referral for Psychological Examination. The City may
require an employee to be examined where there exists a reasonable cause to believe,
based upon specific observations and facts and rational inferences drawn from those
observations and facts, that the employee may be suffering from a mental condition and
such condition prevents the employee from effectively performing the essential job duties
or poses a threat to the health and safety of the employee or others.

Such reasonable suspicion must be based upon the observations of at least two
supervisors or co-workers who have first-hand knowledge or upon reliable information
provided to a supervisor that employee is currently exhibiting conduct which reasonably
demonstrates that the aforementioned circumstances exists. However, before making the
referral, the Chief or his/her designee shall verify the validity of the circumstances by
meeting with the employee or conducting an investigation as to the factual basis of the
alleged conduct. Nothing herein shall limit or otherwise modify the rights of an
employee to file for a grievance arbitration to challenge the basis upon which the Chief
relied in making the referral for the psychological evaluation before the employee shall
be required to submit to a psychological fitness for duty evaluation as established by the
Minnesota Court of Appeals in Hill v. City of Winona. The processing of the grievance
arbitration should be completed within sixty (60) days, if at all possible. If after the
grievance is resolved or arbitrated and the cause for referral is upheld, the employee must
sign all necessary releases and fully cooperate with the fitness for duty examination or be
subject to disciplinary action.

No Conflict With Workers’ Compensation Laws. Nothing in this Section shall be
construed to be in conflict with any rights or obligations of the City or employee under
applicable Workers Compensation laws or regulations. If such conflict arises, the
Workers Compensation laws and regulations shall prevail.

 

Consent under the Minnesota Human Rights Act. If the above provisions are
complied with, the employee is deemed to have consented to this examination under the
Minnesota Human Rights Act.

32
ARTICLE 35 — DURATION AND EFFECTIVE DATE

35.1 Except as herein provided, this Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2013, and
shall continue in full force and effect through December 31, 2015, and thereafter until
modified or amended by mutual agreement of the parties.

Either party desiring to amend or modify this AGREEMENT shall notify the other in
writing by June 15 of the year in which modifications are desired, so as to comply with
the provisions of the Public Employment Labor Relations Act of 1971.

35.2 Retroactive pay adjustments shall apply to all employees of the bargaining unit who are
active employees on the date of signing of the agreement except those who have been
terminated for cause.
